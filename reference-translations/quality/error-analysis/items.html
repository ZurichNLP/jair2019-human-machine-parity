This includes false labeling of diamond purity to drive up prices, false labeling of diamond mass, and lack of post-sales guarantee. Antwerp is the largest diamond trading center in the world. Diamond cutting skills of local craftsman are famous throughout the world. The diamonds sold through the city have been stringently classified and are extremely popular amongst women in China. "A small palm-sized cloth bag, light and airy, is worth nearly a million", a lady surnamed Liu purchasing diamonds on behalf of another was describing her experience at Antwerp in June this year to domestic media. She said that she hid the diamonds in her underwear. For a few days in a row, she would carry them along with her to the toilet and when she took a shower. She felt extremely nervous even when she was walking or sleeping. She claimed that diamonds purchased at Antwerp sold for a price of about 55,000 RMB per carat. Diamonds of the same quality could fetch a retail sales price of 111,000 at Xiamen. <span class="highlighted">She sold all the diamonds she purchased as agent at a 20% premium to the purchase price, and made a huge lump-sum profit of 200,000 yuan.</span> Inland customs regulations stipulate that diamond are not necessities nor are used by the travelers during their trips, and would therefore be regarded as a merchandise and must be declared when entering or leaving the country. Failure to do so would be considered an act of trafficking which is punishable with a prison sentence for serious offenses.</div>

	<div class="source" id="2">尽管还没有被证实，但诸多消息源都表示，苹果2016年秋季发布会将在9月举行，iPhone7真要来了。 虽然苹果公司并未回应，但有关新iPhone的功能、配置已经陆续有消息放出，甚至网上连iPhone7“真机模型”图片都有了。 新一代iPhone可谓“万众瞩目”，火热、紧俏、有钱无货……如果你想第一时间购买到正品，一定要选择一个好渠道，比如说，苏宁。 这加剧了人们对于新手机的失望，“它加长了，却根本不能投射全息图像!这一代iPhone糟透了。” iPhone7像其他iPhone一样，出生之前就伴随着无数秘闻。 另外，还有多个消息源声称，新一代iPhone将取消3.5mm耳机接口，转而使用蓝牙连接和充电接口，这将为苹果增加第二个扬声器提供空间。 能佐证这一消息的另一证据是，早在2014年苹果就允许耳机厂商生产通过充电接口连接的耳机产品。 这些消息或真或假，答案直到苹果2016秋季发布会才能揭晓。 但这并不妨碍业内人士看好iPhone7的前景——许多人认为，iPhone7将很有可能成为苹果对iPhone系列的最后一次大幅升级。 虽然从不久前市场研究机构IDC公布的数据来看，iPhone的市场份额有所下滑。 其中，高盛将苹果的股票维持“买入”评级，而BMO的分析师则认为iPhone7将收获一份历史性的销售成绩。 同时博通公司的CEO Hock Tan也表示，苹果未来的营收增加将有可能超过20%，而这完全得益于iPhone7的推出。 有7%的受访者表示他们有购买iPhone7的打算，而两年前计划购买iPhone6的人数比例只有4%。 据了解，目前持有iPhone6或6Plus的用户群体有20%计划购买iPhone7，这是一个相当高的比例。 其次，有专家分析，大部分果粉都喜欢隔代更换自己的iPhone手机。 据统计，在所有的iPhone用户中，有大约26%的用户已经2年没有更换手机了，也就是差不多有1.2亿的用户的iPhone已经用了2年。 有媒体称，iPhone7生产期间，台湾遭遇数次地震，“台积电生产设施的受破坏程度超出想象，并有可能对初期的iPhone7供应产生影响。” 供需矛盾会影响普通用户，是时候选择一个好渠道，第一时间低价入手正品iPhone7。 据知情人士透露，近期，苏宁高层与苹果公司频频见面，目的就是为了准备充足的货源。 <span class="highlighted">运营商已经与苏宁谈妥，可以预见的是，随着双方的深度合作，必然会为用户带来更低的价格和更贴心的服务。</span> “最低的价格，消费者可能‘一天只需7元钱，就能购买iPhone7’。” 充足的货源与多样的优惠，让购买iPhone7不再“压力山大”，而苏宁的物流，更是会把这种美好变成更直观的体验感。 也许，你半夜就会接到电话，“您好，苏宁易购，您的iPhone7到了。”</div>
	<div class="translation" id="2">Although it has yet to be proven, many information sources indicate that Apple will hold its 2016 Fall event in September. iPhone 7 is really on its way. Although Apple did not respond, news concerning the functions and configuration of the iPhone are being released gradually. Pictures of the "actual phone model" have even appeared on the Internet. The new iPhone could be considered a "public phenomenon". It's popular, sleek, and could not be acquired even if you have the money to pay for it. If you want to buy an original product, you must opt for a proper sales channel such as Suning. This heightened the people's sense of disappointment for the new cellphone. "It became longer, but couldn't project holographs! This iPhone release sucks." Like other iPhones, numerous anecdotes and secret information accompanied the iPhone 7 before its debut. Elsewhere, many sources of information also claimed that the 3.5mm headphone jack will be removed from the new iPhone to be replaced by bluetooth connection and the charging interface. This will give Apple room for adding a second speaker. Another piece of corroborative evidence is that as far back as 2014, Apple had already allowed headphone manufacturers to connect headphone products through the charging interface. The answer to such news, whether true or false, will only be revealed by Apple at the 2016 Fall launch event. This did not stop industry insiders from taking a positive view of the prospects of iPhone 7 however. Many believed that iPhone 7 could very well be the last time Apple would significantly upgrade the iPhone series. However, data recently published by IDC, a market intelligence firm, showed the market share of iPhone has decreased slightly. Goldman Sachs has rated Apple shares as something that can be "bought". BMO analysts believe that iPhone7 will establish a historical record in sales performance. Broadcom CEO Hock Tan also expressed that Apple is expected to achieve more than 20% growth in revenue. This figure can be completely attributed to the release of iPhone7. 7% of those interviewed said they intend to buy iPhone 7 compared to a mere 4% who planned to buy iPhone 6 two years ago. From information available, 20% of users currently holding an iPhone6 or 6Plus have plans for purchasing iPhone7. This proportion is quite substantial. Next, experts analyzed that most Apple fans like to replace their iPhone every other generation. Statistics revealed that among iPhone users, approximately 26% of users have not changed their mobile phones in two years, i.e., the iPhones of about 120 million users have been used for two years. Some media reported that Taiwan has been hit by several earthquakes during the iPhone7 production period. "Damages sustained by TSMC production facilities may have went beyond expectations, and that could have influenced initial supply for iPhone7." Supply and demand conflicts will influence normal users. It is time to select a proper channel and acquire an authentic iPhone7 early at a low price. Insider disclosure revealed that the upper management of Suning and Apple has met frequently in recent times for the purpose of preparing enough resources. <span class="highlighted">Service operators have reached an agreement with Suning. It can be expected that with growing partnership between the two, users will be provided with lower prices and more dedicated services.</span> " The lowest price. The customers might' only RMB 7 a day to get a iPhone7". Sufficient supply of goods and a variety of discounts, buyers of iPhone 7 will not be so stressed out, and Suning's logistics department will all the more turn this happiness into a more intuitive experience. Perhaps you will receive a phone call at midnight. "Hello, this is Suning.com. Your iPhone 7 has arrived."</div>
	<div class="translation" id="2">It has not yet been confirmed yet, but many sources have indicated that Apple's 2016 fall conference will be held in September. The iPhone 7 is really going to come out. Although Apple did not comment, information and specification of the new iPhone has been released and there are "actual" photos of the iPhone 7 on the web. The new generation of the iPhone is going to be slick, popular, and limited, thus if you want to be one of the first one to get a hold of it, be sure to know where to buy it from...like Suning. "This has led to further disappointment in the new phone. It is longer but can't even take videos. This generation of iPhone is terrible." Like the other iPhones, iPhone 7 had its share of secrets before being released. In addition, there are multiple sources claiming that the new generation of iPhone will not feature a 3.5mm headphone jack and use Bluetooth connectivity instead and will just have the charging port. This will provide space for Apple to add a second speaker. As evidence to backup this claim, Apple had developed earphones that would connect to the charging port back in 2014. Regardless of whether the rumors are true or not, we will only know for sure when it is announced in Apple's fall 2016 conference. However, this does not prevent the industry from looking at the potential specification of the iPhone 7 - many believe that the iPhone 7 will most likely be Apple's last major upgrade to the iPhone series. IDC, which is a market research institute recently released data that the market share of iPhone has declined. However, Goldman Sachs will maintain the "buy" rating for Apple's stock, and BMO analysts believe that iPhone7 will come together with a historic sales performance. Additionally, Broadcom’s CEO Hock Tan also stated that Apple’s future revenue growth may exceed 20%, all thanks to the launch of the iPhone 7. Seven percent of respondents said they had plans to purchase the iPhone 7, compared to only four percent who planned to purchase the iPhone 6 two years ago. It is understood that 20% of those currently using the iPhone 6 or 6 Plus plan to purchase the iPhone 7, which is a very high percentage. Also, experts analyzed that most of Apple consumers like to replace their iPhones every generation. According to the data, about 26% of all iPhone users have not changed their phones for 2 years. Which means almost 120 million people have used the iPhone for 2 years. Some media claimed that Taiwan faced several earthquakes during the production of iPhone 7 and, “The damage of TSMC's production facilities was bigger than expected and may affect the initial iPhone 7 supply.” The disparity between supply and demand will affect the average customers. It is time to choose a good place to buy an authentic iPhone 7 early at a lower price. According to informed sources, Suning executives met frequently with Apple in order to prepare enough stock. <span class="highlighted">The company is already in discussion with Suning, and will inevitable provide a lower price and better service for consumers through a high-level of cooperation between the two parties.</span> “At the lowest price, consumers may only need to pay 7 yuan a day to purchase the iPhone 7.” Plentiful stock and various services will make purchasing the iPhone less stressful. Through Suning's logistics, will further lead to a heightened buying experience. You may perhaps get a call in the middle of a night which will say "Hi this is Suning.com. Your iPhone 7 is here."</div>

The next generation of iPhones is "eye-catching", hot, hot, rich and out of stock... If you want to buy the real thing for the first time, make sure you choose a good channel, say, Suning. This added to the frustration over the new phone, "It lengthens, but it doesn't project a hologram at all! This generation of iPhones sucks."

About 26 percent of all iPhone users have not changed their phone in two years, or nearly 120 million users have had their iPhone for two years, according to the report.

"TSMC's production facilities have been damaged beyond imagination and could have an impact on the initial supply of the iPhone 7." Contradictions between supply and demand will affect ordinary users, it is time to choose a good channel, the first time low prices to start the genuine iPhone 7. According to people familiar with the matter, recently, Suning executives have been meeting with Apple frequently in order to prepare an adequate supply. <span class="highlighted">The operator has already negotiated with Suning, and predictably, with the deep cooperation between the two sides, it is bound to bring lower prices and more intimate services to users.</span> "At the lowest price, consumers might be able to buy an iPhone 7 for as little as $7 a day," he said. Sufficient supply and a variety of concessions, so that the purchase of the iPhone 7 is no longer "pressure mountain," and Suning's logistics, is to turn this beautiful into a more intuitive experience.

But they grow extremely slowly, sometimes only about 1cm a year, suggesting that Greenland sharks may have an extraordinarily long life. Traditional dating methods typically use calcified tissue from animals, and some sharks may use fins, but this calcified tissue is rare in Greenland sharks. The new study, led by Julius Nielsen of the University of Copenhagen in Denmark, turned to radiocarbon dating using the eye lens of the Greenland shark. The method has previously been used to determine the age of whales, but it is the first time it has been used to determine the age of fish such as sharks. <span class="highlighted">Their analysis showed that the largest shark had an estimated lifespan of 392 years, with a margin of error of 120 years.</span> This means that the shark is at least 272 years old and is likely to reach a maximum of 512 years old. In addition, female Greenland sharks reportedly do not reach sexual maturity until they are about 4 metres in length, which translates into an age of at least 156 years. As a result, the researchers wrote in their paper, the Greenland shark is the longest-living vertebrate known on Earth, surpassing the previous long-lived champion right whale (211 years old).</div>

Though the iPhone's market share has fallen, according to data released recently by market research firm IDC. Among them, Goldman Sachs maintained a "buy" rating on Apple's stock, while BMO analysts said the iPhone 7 would reap a historic sales performance. At the same time, Hock Tan, CEO of Broadcom, said it was likely that Apple would increase revenue by more than 20 percent in the future, thanks entirely to the launch of the iPhone 7. Seven percent of respondents said they planned to buy the iPhone 7, compared with just four percent two years ago. It is understood that 20 per cent of the current group of users who hold the iPhone 6 or 6Plus plan to buy the iPhone 7, which is a fairly high percentage. Second, there is expert analysis, most of the fruit powder like to replace their iPhone handsets from generation to generation. About 26 percent of all iPhone users have not changed their phone in two years, or nearly 120 million users have had their iPhone for two years, according to the report. Media captionTaiwan has been hit by several earthquakes during the production of the iPhone 7. "TSMC's production facilities have been damaged beyond imagination and could have an impact on the initial supply of the iPhone 7." <span class="highlighted">Contradictions between supply and demand will affect ordinary users, it is time to choose a good channel, the first time low prices to start the genuine iPhone 7.</span> According to people familiar with the matter, recently, Suning executives have been meeting with Apple frequently in order to prepare an adequate supply. The operator has already negotiated with Suning, and predictably, with the deep cooperation between the two sides, it is bound to bring lower prices and more intimate services to users. "At the lowest price, consumers might be able to buy an iPhone 7 for as little as $7 a day," he said. Sufficient supply and a variety of concessions, so that the purchase of the iPhone 7 is no longer "pressure mountain," and Suning's logistics, is to turn this beautiful into a more intuitive experience. Maybe you'll get a call in the middle of the night saying, "Hello, Suning EasyJet, your iPhone 7 is here."</div>
	<div class="translation" id="5">Although it has yet to be proven, many information sources indicate that Apple will hold its 2016 Fall event in September. iPhone 7 is really on its way. Although Apple did not respond, news concerning the functions and configuration of the iPhone are being released gradually. Pictures of the "actual phone model" have even appeared on the Internet. The new iPhone could be considered a "public phenomenon". It's popular, sleek, and could not be acquired even if you have the money to pay for it. If you want to buy an original product, you must opt for a proper sales channel such as Suning. This heightened the people's sense of disappointment for the new cellphone. "It became longer, but couldn't project holographs! This iPhone release sucks." Like other iPhones, numerous anecdotes and secret information accompanied the iPhone 7 before its debut. Elsewhere, many sources of information also claimed that the 3.5mm headphone jack will be removed from the new iPhone to be replaced by bluetooth connection and the charging interface. This will give Apple room for adding a second speaker. Another piece of corroborative evidence is that as far back as 2014, Apple had already allowed headphone manufacturers to connect headphone products through the charging interface. The answer to such news, whether true or false, will only be revealed by Apple at the 2016 Fall launch event. This did not stop industry insiders from taking a positive view of the prospects of iPhone 7 however. Many believed that iPhone 7 could very well be the last time Apple would significantly upgrade the iPhone series. However, data recently published by IDC, a market intelligence firm, showed the market share of iPhone has decreased slightly. Goldman Sachs has rated Apple shares as something that can be "bought". BMO analysts believe that iPhone7 will establish a historical record in sales performance. Broadcom CEO Hock Tan also expressed that Apple is expected to achieve more than 20% growth in revenue. This figure can be completely attributed to the release of iPhone7. 7% of those interviewed said they intend to buy iPhone 7 compared to a mere 4% who planned to buy iPhone 6 two years ago. From information available, 20% of users currently holding an iPhone6 or 6Plus have plans for purchasing iPhone7. This proportion is quite substantial. Next, experts analyzed that most Apple fans like to replace their iPhone every other generation. Statistics revealed that among iPhone users, approximately 26% of users have not changed their mobile phones in two years, i.e., the iPhones of about 120 million users have been used for two years. Some media reported that Taiwan has been hit by several earthquakes during the iPhone7 production period. "Damages sustained by TSMC production facilities may have went beyond expectations, and that could have influenced initial supply for iPhone7." <span class="highlighted">Supply and demand conflicts will influence normal users. It is time to select a proper channel and acquire an authentic iPhone7 early at a low price.</span> Insider disclosure revealed that the upper management of Suning and Apple has met frequently in recent times for the purpose of preparing enough resources. Service operators have reached an agreement with Suning. It can be expected that with growing partnership between the two, users will be provided with lower prices and more dedicated services. " The lowest price. The customers might' only RMB 7 a day to get a iPhone7". Sufficient supply of goods and a variety of discounts, buyers of iPhone 7 will not be so stressed out, and Suning's logistics department will all the more turn this happiness into a more intuitive experience. Perhaps you will receive a phone call at midnight. "Hello, this is Suning.com. Your iPhone 7 has arrived."</div>
	<div class="translation" id="5">It has not yet been confirmed yet, but many sources have indicated that Apple's 2016 fall conference will be held in September. The iPhone 7 is really going to come out. Although Apple did not comment, information and specification of the new iPhone has been released and there are "actual" photos of the iPhone 7 on the web. The new generation of the iPhone is going to be slick, popular, and limited, thus if you want to be one of the first one to get a hold of it, be sure to know where to buy it from...like Suning. "This has led to further disappointment in the new phone. It is longer but can't even take videos. This generation of iPhone is terrible." Like the other iPhones, iPhone 7 had its share of secrets before being released. In addition, there are multiple sources claiming that the new generation of iPhone will not feature a 3.5mm headphone jack and use Bluetooth connectivity instead and will just have the charging port. This will provide space for Apple to add a second speaker. As evidence to backup this claim, Apple had developed earphones that would connect to the charging port back in 2014. Regardless of whether the rumors are true or not, we will only know for sure when it is announced in Apple's fall 2016 conference. However, this does not prevent the industry from looking at the potential specification of the iPhone 7 - many believe that the iPhone 7 will most likely be Apple's last major upgrade to the iPhone series. IDC, which is a market research institute recently released data that the market share of iPhone has declined. However, Goldman Sachs will maintain the "buy" rating for Apple's stock, and BMO analysts believe that iPhone7 will come together with a historic sales performance. Additionally, Broadcom’s CEO Hock Tan also stated that Apple’s future revenue growth may exceed 20%, all thanks to the launch of the iPhone 7. Seven percent of respondents said they had plans to purchase the iPhone 7, compared to only four percent who planned to purchase the iPhone 6 two years ago. It is understood that 20% of those currently using the iPhone 6 or 6 Plus plan to purchase the iPhone 7, which is a very high percentage. Also, experts analyzed that most of Apple consumers like to replace their iPhones every generation. According to the data, about 26% of all iPhone users have not changed their phones for 2 years. Which means almost 120 million people have used the iPhone for 2 years. Some media claimed that Taiwan faced several earthquakes during the production of iPhone 7 and, “The damage of TSMC's production facilities was bigger than expected and may affect the initial iPhone 7 supply.” <span class="highlighted">The disparity between supply and demand will affect the average customers. It is time to choose a good place to buy an authentic iPhone 7 early at a lower price.</span> According to informed sources, Suning executives met frequently with Apple in order to prepare enough stock. The company is already in discussion with Suning, and will inevitable provide a lower price and better service for consumers through a high-level of cooperation between the two parties. “At the lowest price, consumers may only need to pay 7 yuan a day to purchase the iPhone 7.” Plentiful stock and various services will make purchasing the iPhone less stressful. Through Suning's logistics, will further lead to a heightened buying experience. You may perhaps get a call in the middle of a night which will say "Hi this is Suning.com. Your iPhone 7 is here."</div>

	<div class="translation" id="6">Zhang Binbin, a daughter of Xiamen, had "wonderful hand posture" and experienced multiple "reversals" during her career as a shooter. Zhang Donghong, a resident at Dongyuan Village at Xiang'an District in Xiamen, just swapped his old 29-inch television for a large 65-inch set several days ago. This daughter of a common farmer is Zhang Binbin, who just won a silver medal for China in the 50 meter rifle three positions in the Rio Olympics. During the evening of the 11th, Zhang Donghong, his wife, and dozens of other family members and friends stood before this new television and witnessed how his daughter started a miraculous spree that brought her from the brink of being dropped out of the competition to a medal winning score. On the day of the competition, Zhang Binbin had a mid to low ranking at one point, and a spot in the final appeared extremely remote. Parents, family, and friends did not give up, and continued to watch to live stream. When the other athletes completed their firing, Zhang Binbin's rank kept rising until she secured the right to compete in the finals. Everyone at her home exploded in a great cheer. In the finals, Zhang Binbin, who again fell behind in the rankings at one point, became increasingly steady as she fired the last few shots. She finished just 0.2 points behind the champion, clinching the silver medal. Across her 16-year shooting career, Zhang Binbin, who is 27-year old this year, brushed past this hard-won silver medal on several occasions. The mother, Zhang Xiaolong, told the reporter that when everyone was still hesitant, Zhang Binbin found several "young persuaders" from the same village. The "little lobbyists" are the kids from the same family participated the training by recommendation at hat time, including the cousin of Zhang Binbin. Not long after entering the Xiamen team, Zhang Binbin once again actively returned to study at a school in Xiang'an due to family difficulties and other reasons. Zhang Binbin returned to Xiamen Team after being repeatedly persuaded by her first coach Zhang Yajie. After joining the provincial team, Zhang Binbin, who took a long time to advance to the national team, returned home at one point because she saw no hope. <span class="highlighted">This visit included more than just Coach Zhang Yajie. Official leaders and coaches from the Xiamen Shooting Shejian Sports Center and Fujian Provincial Team also came by and successfully persuaded Zhang Binbin to return to the provincial team.</span> Just like the competition yesterday, this daughter of Xiamen persisted and once again turned the tables in her shooting career. "Every coach has different way of picking team members. At the time, I noticed that Binbin has really nice hands, and fell in love with them immediately." Zhang Donghong also recalled that although his daughter's performance was not the best at the group training test, the number of rounds she shot was very stable. This was also a key factor why Zhang Binbin attracted the attention of her coach. During training, the farm girl Zhang Binbin was so committed that she left a lasting impression with Zhang Yajie. He recollected that more than one year after Zhang Binbin joined the Xiamen shooting team, the team conducted a standing posture rifle firing training. Team members were required to stand still for half an hour. Zhang Xiaolong told the reporter that her daughter is a quiet and obedient child and has loved drawing and making her own toys since a young age. "Originally, I stayed at home to tailor some clothes, sewing and mending them as needed. Binbin would sit by the corner, collecting the scrap fabrics to make her own fabric doll." She said that her daughter would often sew and make her own toys. Coupled with the fact that she was good at drawing, she was able to create a lifelike face and clothing for the dolls she made. As an athlete, Zhang Binbin spends little time with family, and could only return home during weekends and public holidays. Usually, they communicate using the telephone. Her parents said that whether when meeting in person or talking on the phone, Zhang Binbin seldom said she found things difficult. More often than not, she would chat about happy things with parents. Since they hardly see their daughter, the parents carefully preserved the artwork that their girl has made as a child and the glories that she had later won. Zhang Xiaolong showed the reporter the cartoon artwork his daughter created. "If she didn't become a archer, she would probably continue to draw." There is a cabinet located at the second floor living room in Zhang Binbin's home that is filled with the plaques, medals, and certificates that she had won. Zhang Donghong displayed the medals and awards neatly, and kept all the certificates in a folder. "These are the honors Binbin has received over the years on the basis of her hard work and dedication. All of us cherish them."</div>

	<div class="translation" id="6">The Young Zhang Binbin from Xiamen: She started her shooting career as she had "Beautiful Hands" and went through various "struggles". Zhang Donghong from Dongyuan Village in Xiang'an District of Xiamen just replaced an old 29-inch TV with a 65-inch TV at his home. This average farmer's daughter is Zhang Binbin who won the silver medal in the 50 meter rifle three positions event at the Rio Olympic Games for China on the evening of the 11th. Zhang Donghong and his wife along with a number of friends and family were in front of the new TV on the night of the 11th to witness their daughter make a miraculous comeback from almost being eliminated In the day of the event, Zhang Binbin was at one point in the lower part of the ranking and did not seem she would reach the finals. However her parents and close friends did not give up on her as they kept their eyes on the text of the broadcast. Upon seeing other players finishing and where they were ranked, they saw Binbin's name go up the rank and secured a seat in the finals, when the families and friends burst in cheers at home. In the finals, she was on the bottom end of the ranking but her last few shots got more stable and won the silver medal with only 0.2 points behind the champion. For Zhang Binbin who is already 27, it was a hard-fought silver medal in her 16 years of her shooting career. Zhang's mother, Xiaolong told the reporters that when they felt hesitant about her doing this, Zhang Binbin brought a group of "young kids" from the same village to persuade her parents. The "young kids" were from the same village who were also recommended to participate in the training at the same time. Among them was Zhang Binbin's cousin. However, shortly after joining the Xiamen team, Zhang Binbin decided to go back to school in Xiang'an to study due to family hardships. But after the coach Zhang Yajie, kept convincing her, she returned to the Xiamen team again. After being in the provincial team, Zhang Binbin once again failed to get in the national team. As she could not see hope in getting in, she returned home once again. <span class="highlighted">This time, not only coach Zhang, but also the managers and coaches of the Xiamen Shooting and Archery Sports Center and the Fujian provincial team came to her home to persuade Zhang Binbin to return to the provincial team.</span> Like yesterday's game, she persisted and overcame the hurdles in her shooting career. "The way a coach decides who makes the team is different. However for me, I knew she was it when I saw Zhang Binbin's hands." Zhang Donhong also remembered that during the test in the training, despite her scores not being the best, her points were very consistent which was the reason the coaches were fond of Zhang Binbin. In the process of training Zhang Binbin, Zhang Yajie remembered clearly the input provided by this farm girl. He recalls that around 1 year after Zhang Binbin joined the Xiamen Shooting team, the team had a endurance training exercise where they were not allowed to move for half an hour. Zhang Xiaolong told the reporters that her daughter was always a quiet and obedient girl who liked to draw and play with homemade toys when she was small. "When I would sew and repair clothes at home, Binbin would use the scrap pieces and make a doll herself. She said that her daughter would often sew her own toys. As she also liked to draw, the facial expression and the clothes of the dolls she made looked really good. As an athlete, Zhang Binbin saw her family less and less, and would only go back home during the holidays, and usually contacted each other by phone. Her parents said that regardless of being together or on the phone, she would seldom talk about her hardship and would mostly talk about something happy with her parents. As they aren't able to see their daughter often, they make sure to carefully keep the drawings she made when she was little at home. Zhang Xiaolong showed a comic drawn by her daughter to the reporter and said "if she didn't become a shooter, she would have probably continued drawing." In the living room on the second floor of Zhang Binbin's house, there is a cupboard full of medals, and certificates she has won. Zhang Donghong arranged the medals neatly, and the certificates in a folder. “These are the result of Binbin's hard work in these 10 years and so, and are very precious to us."</div>

	<div class="translation" id="7">The Young Zhang Binbin from Xiamen: She started her shooting career as she had "Beautiful Hands" and went through various "struggles". Zhang Donghong from Dongyuan Village in Xiang'an District of Xiamen just replaced an old 29-inch TV with a 65-inch TV at his home. This average farmer's daughter is Zhang Binbin who won the silver medal in the 50 meter rifle three positions event at the Rio Olympic Games for China on the evening of the 11th. Zhang Donghong and his wife along with a number of friends and family were in front of the new TV on the night of the 11th to witness their daughter make a miraculous comeback from almost being eliminated In the day of the event, Zhang Binbin was at one point in the lower part of the ranking and did not seem she would reach the finals. However her parents and close friends did not give up on her as they kept their eyes on the text of the broadcast. Upon seeing other players finishing and where they were ranked, they saw Binbin's name go up the rank and secured a seat in the finals, when the families and friends burst in cheers at home. In the finals, she was on the bottom end of the ranking but her last few shots got more stable and won the silver medal with only 0.2 points behind the champion. For Zhang Binbin who is already 27, it was a hard-fought silver medal in her 16 years of her shooting career. Zhang's mother, Xiaolong told the reporters that when they felt hesitant about her doing this, Zhang Binbin brought a group of "young kids" from the same village to persuade her parents. The "young kids" were from the same village who were also recommended to participate in the training at the same time. Among them was Zhang Binbin's cousin. However, shortly after joining the Xiamen team, Zhang Binbin decided to go back to school in Xiang'an to study due to family hardships. But after the coach Zhang Yajie, kept convincing her, she returned to the Xiamen team again. After being in the provincial team, Zhang Binbin once again failed to get in the national team. As she could not see hope in getting in, she returned home once again. This time, not only coach Zhang, but also the managers and coaches of the Xiamen Shooting and Archery Sports Center and the Fujian provincial team came to her home to persuade Zhang Binbin to return to the provincial team. Like yesterday's game, she persisted and overcame the hurdles in her shooting career. "The way a coach decides who makes the team is different. However for me, I knew she was it when I saw Zhang Binbin's hands." Zhang Donhong also remembered that during the test in the training, despite her scores not being the best, her points were very consistent which was the reason the coaches were fond of Zhang Binbin. In the process of training Zhang Binbin, Zhang Yajie remembered clearly the input provided by this farm girl. <span class="highlighted">He recalls that around 1 year after Zhang Binbin joined the Xiamen Shooting team, the team had a endurance training exercise where they were not allowed to move for half an hour.</span> Zhang Xiaolong told the reporters that her daughter was always a quiet and obedient girl who liked to draw and play with homemade toys when she was small. "When I would sew and repair clothes at home, Binbin would use the scrap pieces and make a doll herself. She said that her daughter would often sew her own toys. As she also liked to draw, the facial expression and the clothes of the dolls she made looked really good. As an athlete, Zhang Binbin saw her family less and less, and would only go back home during the holidays, and usually contacted each other by phone. Her parents said that regardless of being together or on the phone, she would seldom talk about her hardship and would mostly talk about something happy with her parents. As they aren't able to see their daughter often, they make sure to carefully keep the drawings she made when she was little at home. Zhang Xiaolong showed a comic drawn by her daughter to the reporter and said "if she didn't become a shooter, she would have probably continued drawing." In the living room on the second floor of Zhang Binbin's house, there is a cupboard full of medals, and certificates she has won. Zhang Donghong arranged the medals neatly, and the certificates in a folder. “These are the result of Binbin's hard work in these 10 years and so, and are very precious to us."</div>
	<div class="translation" id="7">Zhang Binbin, a daughter of Xiamen, had "wonderful hand posture" and experienced multiple "reversals" during her career as a shooter. Zhang Donghong, a resident at Dongyuan Village at Xiang'an District in Xiamen, just swapped his old 29-inch television for a large 65-inch set several days ago. This daughter of a common farmer is Zhang Binbin, who just won a silver medal for China in the 50 meter rifle three positions in the Rio Olympics. During the evening of the 11th, Zhang Donghong, his wife, and dozens of other family members and friends stood before this new television and witnessed how his daughter started a miraculous spree that brought her from the brink of being dropped out of the competition to a medal winning score. On the day of the competition, Zhang Binbin had a mid to low ranking at one point, and a spot in the final appeared extremely remote. Parents, family, and friends did not give up, and continued to watch to live stream. When the other athletes completed their firing, Zhang Binbin's rank kept rising until she secured the right to compete in the finals. Everyone at her home exploded in a great cheer. In the finals, Zhang Binbin, who again fell behind in the rankings at one point, became increasingly steady as she fired the last few shots. She finished just 0.2 points behind the champion, clinching the silver medal. Across her 16-year shooting career, Zhang Binbin, who is 27-year old this year, brushed past this hard-won silver medal on several occasions. The mother, Zhang Xiaolong, told the reporter that when everyone was still hesitant, Zhang Binbin found several "young persuaders" from the same village. The "little lobbyists" are the kids from the same family participated the training by recommendation at hat time, including the cousin of Zhang Binbin. Not long after entering the Xiamen team, Zhang Binbin once again actively returned to study at a school in Xiang'an due to family difficulties and other reasons. Zhang Binbin returned to Xiamen Team after being repeatedly persuaded by her first coach Zhang Yajie. After joining the provincial team, Zhang Binbin, who took a long time to advance to the national team, returned home at one point because she saw no hope. This visit included more than just Coach Zhang Yajie. Official leaders and coaches from the Xiamen Shooting Shejian Sports Center and Fujian Provincial Team also came by and successfully persuaded Zhang Binbin to return to the provincial team. Just like the competition yesterday, this daughter of Xiamen persisted and once again turned the tables in her shooting career. "Every coach has different way of picking team members. At the time, I noticed that Binbin has really nice hands, and fell in love with them immediately." Zhang Donghong also recalled that although his daughter's performance was not the best at the group training test, the number of rounds she shot was very stable. This was also a key factor why Zhang Binbin attracted the attention of her coach. During training, the farm girl Zhang Binbin was so committed that she left a lasting impression with Zhang Yajie. <span class="highlighted">He recollected that more than one year after Zhang Binbin joined the Xiamen shooting team, the team conducted a standing posture rifle firing training. Team members were required to stand still for half an hour.</span> Zhang Xiaolong told the reporter that her daughter is a quiet and obedient child and has loved drawing and making her own toys since a young age. "Originally, I stayed at home to tailor some clothes, sewing and mending them as needed. Binbin would sit by the corner, collecting the scrap fabrics to make her own fabric doll." She said that her daughter would often sew and make her own toys. Coupled with the fact that she was good at drawing, she was able to create a lifelike face and clothing for the dolls she made. As an athlete, Zhang Binbin spends little time with family, and could only return home during weekends and public holidays. Usually, they communicate using the telephone. Her parents said that whether when meeting in person or talking on the phone, Zhang Binbin seldom said she found things difficult. More often than not, she would chat about happy things with parents. Since they hardly see their daughter, the parents carefully preserved the artwork that their girl has made as a child and the glories that she had later won. Zhang Xiaolong showed the reporter the cartoon artwork his daughter created. "If she didn't become a archer, she would probably continue to draw." There is a cabinet located at the second floor living room in Zhang Binbin's home that is filled with the plaques, medals, and certificates that she had won. Zhang Donghong displayed the medals and awards neatly, and kept all the certificates in a folder. "These are the honors Binbin has received over the years on the basis of her hard work and dedication. All of us cherish them."</div>

	<div class="translation" id="8">Gracia is a cute female toucan with the scent of the jungle about her. In the Central American country of Costa Rica, the toucan Gracia and its story are extremely well-known. The August 10 press conference finally revealed Gracia after recovering from the operation, displaying its brand new 3D-printed plastic beak. This toucan whose upper beak was broken by someone, and which was on the brink of death, has now finally received a new lease of life. This is the day that the bird has reached 100% recovery and the day when it could be moved to a luxurious bird house and meet its human friends who have been caring for it. Gracia appears to be rather shy after moving to her new home, but quickly revealed her lively side, playing in the pool of water and using her new beak to eat grapes. To remind people of the abuse it once suffered, the technicians did not color its new beak, but kept it white, the original color of the 3D printing material. The external layer of the beak is a thin keratin sheath. The beak is hollow and only reinforced by thin, criss-crossing supporting struts of bone. Although reinforced internally, the toucan's beak is still fragile, and will crack when it is harmed. The animal aid center, an ornithologist, and a 3D printing company from the United States are working together, making several "experimental beaks" for Gracia before creating the "perfect beak" that best suits the bird. Now Gracia has become proficient in using her beak to drink, eat, and even pick up fine seed grains. "The design of the final product took about two months; printing took just four to five hours." "3D printing is not for next generation. It has become part of our life." Thomas Lange, President of SG3D told the  Xinhua News Agency. On January 2015, Gracia the toucan was found, bleeding from its mouth, by a person in a farm at Gracia, Alajuela Province in central Costa Rica. At the time, its upper beak was cruelly broken by a group of youths. It could not eat and was dying. Once reported in mass media, Gracia's sad state initiated a wave of outcry against animal abuse in and outside Costa Rica. The public requested more rigorous animal protection laws to be established, and punishment for abusers to be stepped out. People came forward voluntarily, and did the best they could to help Grecia regain its life prior to the injury. Even Chuck Hull, the inventor of 3D printing technology, also contributed towards the design of Gracia's upper beak. "Gracia's condition is quite unique. Less than 1 cm of its upper beak has remained, making it difficult to install a new beak." "We first scanned Gracia and then designed and manufactured an extended prosthetic that is slightly longer than its remaining upper beak. The prosthetic is then glued to its upper beak." "This will help reduce further invasive injury on Grecia," Lange told a XInhua international news reporter. <span class="highlighted">Prior to installing the prosthetics, workers cleaned the broken beak for Gracia everyday to prevent infections.</span> Thousands of miles away, the story of Gracia the toucan has moved renowned documentary filmmaker Paula Heredia and investigative journalist John Hoffman. Toucan Nation is a documentary that recorded in detail the process of fitting a new beak for Grecia, which was broadcast on Animal Planet this month. The documentary Toucan Nation showed how a small toucan bird could change a country and encourage every citizen to participate in the movement against animal abuse.</div>
	<div class="translation" id="8">Grecia is an adorable female toucan that exudes a tropical feel. The story of Grecia the toucan has been known early on in the Central American country of Costa Rica. In the press release on August 30th, Grecia who recovered from the surgery showed off her new prosthetic 3D printed beak to the public. The toucan whose beak was hacked off by humans and was dying a year and half ago is now reborn. This day not only confirms that she is 100% healthy, but also is a day when she will be relocated to a luxurious cage and a day for those who care about her to be able to see her. Grecia was a bit shy after moving to her new home but became more lively as she played in the water and ate grapes with her new beak. The engineering specialist did not newly paint the 3D printed beak to serve as a reminder to people of what she went through, thus leaving it in the original white color of the 3D printing material. The outer layer of the beak features a thin wall of keratin, and the inside is generally hollow and is only supported by several thin bone struts. Despite the interior being reinforced, the toucan's beak is still frail and can break when damaged. With the collaboration with the animal rescue center, bird specialists, and a US 3D printing company, the group was able to create several "trial versions" to identify and finally create "the perfect one". Grecia can now skillfully use her new beak to drink water, eat, and even pick up small grains. "The design of the final product took around 2 months and the printing only took 4-5 hours." The president of SG3D Printing, Thomas Lange explained to Xinhua International during an interview that, "3D printing is not a technology of the future but has already stepped in to our lives". In January 2015, a bloodied toucan (Grecia) was found on a farm in Grecia, Alajuela Province located in central Costa Rica. The beak was brutally hacked off by a group of youngsters. She could not eat at all and was in critical condition. After the media covered the story of Grecia's tragic situation, it triggered a wave of opposition on animal cruelty in and outside of Costa Rica. People have since called out for a stricter animal protection law and for harsher penalties for animal abuse. People proactively came together to do their best to help Grecia recover and regain her life before being injured. Chuck Hall who is the inventor of 3D printing was also involved in the design of Grecia's beak. "Grecia's situation was a very special one as there was less than 1 cm of the upper jaw left, which caused many difficulties in attaching the beak." "We first scanned Grecia then designed an extended cap that was a bit longer than the remnant beak, then glued the prosthetic beak". Lange told the reporters of Xinhua International that "By doing so, we can prevent further injury for Grecia". <span class="highlighted">Before installing the prosthetic beak, the staff had to keep Grecia clean everyday to prevent infections.</span> The story of Grecia the toucan travelled the distance and touched John Hoffman who is a producer at Discovery News Channel and Paul Heredia who is a famous documentary director. They filmed bits and pieces of the installation of Grecia's new beak to make a documentary called "Toucan Nation" which was aired on Animal Planet this month. The documentary "Toucan Nation" shows how a small Toucan inspired a nation to make changes and citizens to get involved to stop animal cruelty.</div>

In the Central American country of Costa Rica, the toucan Gracia and its story have long been a household name. At a press conference on August 10, Gracia, who is recovering from surgery, finally appeared to show off her brand-new, 3D printed plastic beak. The dying toucan, which had its beak snapped off a year and a half ago, has been given a new lease of life. This day heralds not only its 100 per cent return to health, but also its move into the luxurious aviary and its meeting with human friends who care about it. Gracia, who had just entered her new home, was a little shy, but soon became active, wallowing in the basin and eating the grapes with her new beak. To remind people of the damage it has suffered, instead of painting its new beak, technicians have kept the original white of the 3D printing material. The beak is covered with a thin, horny sheath that is hollow inside, with only a few thin, bone-supporting poles interlaced. Despite this internal reinforcement, the toucan's beak is still fragile and will break when it is damaged. The Animal Rescue Center, ornithologists and an American 3D printing company worked together to create several "experimental beaks" for Gracia, finally creating the "perfect beak" for her. Gracia is now adept at using her new beak to drink, eat and even pick up tiny grains. "The final product took about two months to design and only four or five hours to print." "3D printing is not the technology of the future, it has really come into your life and mine," Thomas Langer, chairman of SG3D printing company, told Xinhua International. Gracia, a toucan covered in blood, was discovered on a farm in Gracia, in the central Alajuela province of Costa Rica, in January 2015. At that time, its beak was brutally broken by a group of young people, it was completely unable to eat, life-threatening. The tragedy in Gracia has caused a flurry of calls against animal cruelty in and around Costa Rica after media reports. There have been calls for stricter animal protection laws and greater penalties for abusers. People came spontaneously and did their best to help Gracia get back to life as much as possible before the injury. Even Chuck Hull, the inventor of 3D printing technology, was involved in the design of Gracia's upper beak. "The case of Gracia is unique in that the remaining part of its upper beak is less than one centimetre, which makes it difficult to install a new beak," he said. "We scanned Gracia and then designed and made an extended prosthesis that was slightly longer than the rest of her upper beak.

These navigation channels are part of the Grand Canal. </span> The costs for the upgrades and reconstruction for these two will be covered with social financing, and the costs have been approved by the appropriate departments of the provincial government.  The Laowanfu River passes through Jinxiang and Yutai before linking with the Grand Canal through Nanyang Lake. Laowanfu River is a total of 32.5 kilometers. According to navigation requirements, the Laowanfu River waterway will need to adopt a proper maintenance method, deepen the water level, and straighten the channel, to improve the navigation conditions.  The waterway that goes through Jinxiang County and Rencheng District which then enters the main navigation channel of the Grand Canal via Nanyang Lake is 19 kilometers long. The work on the two channels started in February 2011 and was completed in January 2015. The principal for the investment and construction was by the Jining City Anping Canal Logistics Service Center. Based on the “paying off loans with a service fee” principle, the Anping Canal Logistics Service Center of Jining City will collect toll fees subject to the standards approved by the Shandong Provincial Price Bureau. One of such standard is the base toll calculated at 1.75 yuan/dwt, and a toll mileage of 0.05 yuan/km dwt. The toll collection period is from June 15, 2016 to June 14th, 2019. Reporters learned from the Jining City Port and Navigation Bureau that there are currently 4 tolled waterway in Jining consisting of Weishui River, Baima River, Beidake River, and Laowanfu River. The 4 waterways are tributaries of the Grand Canal and were upgraded via social financing. The Weishui River upgrade project was the first to feature the collaborative "Government + Market" model for waterway improvement in the Shangdong Province. The Government funded most of it while social funding was used to cover the balance. Baima River, Laowanfu River and Beidake River projects were done purely for the interest of the market. The budget allocated from the state finance is not enough to cover the cost of the project construction, and would impede on the upgrade progress of the channels. The use of social funding for the construction of public infrastructure meets the requirements of national policies and has also become a way to overcome funding issues.</div>

Based on navigational requirements, the Laowanfu River channel has adopted a method of maintenance and reconstruction, having partially dredged the riverbed to increase its depth, and partially straightening sharp bends in the river, among others. Conditions of the shipping channel have improved. This navigation channel has a total length of 19 km, flowing through Jinxiang County, Rencheng District, and entering, via Nanyang Lake, the Grand Canal. Constructions to renovate the two navigational channels began in February 2011, and were completed in January 2015 for inspections. The Jining City Anping Canal Logistic Service Center is the primary investor and operator of the channels. According to the " Build by loan, Charge to repay" principle, Anping Canal Logistic Service Center will charge the passage toll according to the rated approved by Shandong Price Bureau. Of which, a basic transportation fee is charged at 1.75 RMB/ton carried. Mileage transportation fee is charged at 0.05 RMB/km for each ton carried.

The four shipping lanes are tributary channels of the Beijing-Hangzhou Grand Canal, and were upgraded and reconstructed by way of public financing. The project for upgrading and reconstructing the Zhushui River navigation channel is a first time attempt to use a "government + market" model. The project is an infrastructure undertaking for river ports in Shandong Province, with the government being the main investor while social investments make up for the gap in funding required. Baima River, Laowanfu River, Beidaliu River and other tributary navigational channels have adopted a pure market-based operating approach. The funds provided by the national budget could not satisfy construction costs, limiting the progress for navigation route upgrades.

	<div class="translation" id="10">Gracia is a cute female toucan with the scent of the jungle about her. In the Central American country of Costa Rica, the toucan Gracia and its story are extremely well-known. The August 10 press conference finally revealed Gracia after recovering from the operation, displaying its brand new 3D-printed plastic beak. This toucan whose upper beak was broken by someone, and which was on the brink of death, has now finally received a new lease of life. This is the day that the bird has reached 100% recovery and the day when it could be moved to a luxurious bird house and meet its human friends who have been caring for it. Gracia appears to be rather shy after moving to her new home, but quickly revealed her lively side, playing in the pool of water and using her new beak to eat grapes. To remind people of the abuse it once suffered, the technicians did not color its new beak, but kept it white, the original color of the 3D printing material. The external layer of the beak is a thin keratin sheath. The beak is hollow and only reinforced by thin, criss-crossing supporting struts of bone. Although reinforced internally, the toucan's beak is still fragile, and will crack when it is harmed. The animal aid center, an ornithologist, and a 3D printing company from the United States are working together, making several "experimental beaks" for Gracia before creating the "perfect beak" that best suits the bird. Now Gracia has become proficient in using her beak to drink, eat, and even pick up fine seed grains. "The design of the final product took about two months; printing took just four to five hours." "3D printing is not for next generation. It has become part of our life." Thomas Lange, President of SG3D told the  Xinhua News Agency. On January 2015, Gracia the toucan was found, bleeding from its mouth, by a person in a farm at Gracia, Alajuela Province in central Costa Rica. At the time, its upper beak was cruelly broken by a group of youths. It could not eat and was dying. Once reported in mass media, Gracia's sad state initiated a wave of outcry against animal abuse in and outside Costa Rica. The public requested more rigorous animal protection laws to be established, and punishment for abusers to be stepped out. People came forward voluntarily, and did the best they could to help Grecia regain its life prior to the injury. Even Chuck Hull, the inventor of 3D printing technology, also contributed towards the design of Gracia's upper beak. "Gracia's condition is quite unique. Less than 1 cm of its upper beak has remained, making it difficult to install a new beak." "We first scanned Gracia and then designed and manufactured an extended prosthetic that is slightly longer than its remaining upper beak. The prosthetic is then glued to its upper beak." "This will help reduce further invasive injury on Grecia," Lange told a XInhua international news reporter. Prior to installing the prosthetics, workers cleaned the broken beak for Gracia everyday to prevent infections. <span class="highlighted">Thousands of miles away, the story of Gracia the toucan has moved renowned documentary filmmaker Paula Heredia and investigative journalist John Hoffman.</span> Toucan Nation is a documentary that recorded in detail the process of fitting a new beak for Grecia, which was broadcast on Animal Planet this month. The documentary Toucan Nation showed how a small toucan bird could change a country and encourage every citizen to participate in the movement against animal abuse.</div>
	<div class="translation" id="10">Grecia is an adorable female toucan that exudes a tropical feel. The story of Grecia the toucan has been known early on in the Central American country of Costa Rica. In the press release on August 30th, Grecia who recovered from the surgery showed off her new prosthetic 3D printed beak to the public. The toucan whose beak was hacked off by humans and was dying a year and half ago is now reborn. This day not only confirms that she is 100% healthy, but also is a day when she will be relocated to a luxurious cage and a day for those who care about her to be able to see her. Grecia was a bit shy after moving to her new home but became more lively as she played in the water and ate grapes with her new beak. The engineering specialist did not newly paint the 3D printed beak to serve as a reminder to people of what she went through, thus leaving it in the original white color of the 3D printing material. The outer layer of the beak features a thin wall of keratin, and the inside is generally hollow and is only supported by several thin bone struts. Despite the interior being reinforced, the toucan's beak is still frail and can break when damaged. With the collaboration with the animal rescue center, bird specialists, and a US 3D printing company, the group was able to create several "trial versions" to identify and finally create "the perfect one". Grecia can now skillfully use her new beak to drink water, eat, and even pick up small grains. "The design of the final product took around 2 months and the printing only took 4-5 hours." The president of SG3D Printing, Thomas Lange explained to Xinhua International during an interview that, "3D printing is not a technology of the future but has already stepped in to our lives". In January 2015, a bloodied toucan (Grecia) was found on a farm in Grecia, Alajuela Province located in central Costa Rica. The beak was brutally hacked off by a group of youngsters. She could not eat at all and was in critical condition. After the media covered the story of Grecia's tragic situation, it triggered a wave of opposition on animal cruelty in and outside of Costa Rica. People have since called out for a stricter animal protection law and for harsher penalties for animal abuse. People proactively came together to do their best to help Grecia recover and regain her life before being injured. Chuck Hall who is the inventor of 3D printing was also involved in the design of Grecia's beak. "Grecia's situation was a very special one as there was less than 1 cm of the upper jaw left, which caused many difficulties in attaching the beak." "We first scanned Grecia then designed an extended cap that was a bit longer than the remnant beak, then glued the prosthetic beak". Lange told the reporters of Xinhua International that "By doing so, we can prevent further injury for Grecia". Before installing the prosthetic beak, the staff had to keep Grecia clean everyday to prevent infections. <span class="highlighted">The story of Grecia the toucan travelled the distance and touched John Hoffman who is a producer at Discovery News Channel and Paul Heredia who is a famous documentary director.</span> They filmed bits and pieces of the installation of Grecia's new beak to make a documentary called "Toucan Nation" which was aired on Animal Planet this month. The documentary "Toucan Nation" shows how a small Toucan inspired a nation to make changes and citizens to get involved to stop animal cruelty.</div>

In the Central American country of Costa Rica, the toucan Gracia and its story have long been a household name. At a press conference on August 10, Gracia, who is recovering from surgery, finally appeared to show off her brand-new, 3D printed plastic beak. The dying toucan, which had its beak snapped off a year and a half ago, has been given a new lease of life. This day heralds not only its 100 per cent return to health, but also its move into the luxurious aviary and its meeting with human friends who care about it. Gracia, who had just entered her new home, was a little shy, but soon became active, wallowing in the basin and eating the grapes with her new beak. To remind people of the damage it has suffered, instead of painting its new beak, technicians have kept the original white of the 3D printing material. The beak is covered with a thin, horny sheath that is hollow inside, with only a few thin, bone-supporting poles interlaced. Despite this internal reinforcement, the toucan's beak is still fragile and will break when it is damaged. The Animal Rescue Center, ornithologists and an American 3D printing company worked together to create several "experimental beaks" for Gracia, finally creating the "perfect beak" for her. Gracia is now adept at using her new beak to drink, eat and even pick up tiny grains. "The final product took about two months to design and only four or five hours to print." "3D printing is not the technology of the future, it has really come into your life and mine," Thomas Langer, chairman of SG3D printing company, told Xinhua International. Gracia, a toucan covered in blood, was discovered on a farm in Gracia, in the central Alajuela province of Costa Rica, in January 2015. At that time, its beak was brutally broken by a group of young people, it was completely unable to eat, life-threatening. The tragedy in Gracia has caused a flurry of calls against animal cruelty in and around Costa Rica after media reports. There have been calls for stricter animal protection laws and greater penalties for abusers. People came spontaneously and did their best to help Gracia get back to life as much as possible before the injury. Even Chuck Hull, the inventor of 3D printing technology, was involved in the design of Gracia's upper beak. "The case of Gracia is unique in that the remaining part of its upper beak is less than one centimetre, which makes it difficult to install a new beak," he said. "We scanned Gracia and then designed and made an extended prosthesis that was slightly longer than the rest of her upper beak. "This will reduce further invasive damage to Gracia," Langer told Xinhua International. Before installing the prosthesis, staff had to clean up Gracia's beak every day to prevent infection. <span class="highlighted">Thousands of miles away, the story of Toucan Gracia moved famous documentary filmmaker Paula Heredia and Discovery News producer John Hoffman.</span> They chronicled the installation of Gracia's new beak and recorded a documentary, "Land of the Toucans," which was shown on Animal Planet this month.

	<div class="source" id="13">据媒体披露，由于此前资本大规模涌入互联网医药，造成目前产品同质化的问题严重，投资热潮渐退，资本进入观望期。 另据香港艾力彼医院管理研究中心数据显示，创业一年内的互联网医疗公司大量死亡，约20%的初创互联网医疗企业已不复存在。 然而，就在大部分互联网医疗企业挣扎在A轮或B轮的融资路上的时候，有几家细分领域领先企业仍能获得资本热捧。 看来，互联网医疗创业断不可“一窝蜂”，而是要看准市场需求，沉得下心做专，做深。 鱼跃出资1200.00万元，占注册资本的40%，九州通器械公司出资1800.00万元，占注册资本的60%。 近年来，随着国家在医疗信息化方面的政策支持，电子化、集成化的供应链管理系统逐步进入各级医院。 此次鱼跃与九州通的合作正是瞄准了市场的需求，帮助医院搭建先进供应链管理系统，并以此为契机谋求更多合作。 与很多互联网医疗公司贪大求全不同，iBaby从最初就专注于互联网产科垂直领域，深耕孕妈和医生两端。 孕妈不仅可以免费24小时和一对一的主管医生问诊，还可以付费定向寻医问诊。 而在医生端，iBaby通过采取组织专家给基层医生开展在线讲座、同行交流、病例讨论等微讲座的形式，打破地域限制。 目前医生端开设三个板块，分别为医生继续教育、医生社交和医生求助。 <span class="highlighted">提供包括在线学习、病例讨论、学术交流；同医院、同科室医生之间社交平台；医患关系或个人生活所需要的法律援助、创业支持等服务内容。</span> 据媒体报道，CEO王磊近日表示阿里健康“愿意沉下心来”拿下健康大数据。 互联网公司、数据公司缺少专业性，在同一词条上的书写方法上都达不到统一。 阿里目前在医疗健康领域的布局分为三块，分别是阿里健康、天猫医药馆和支付宝未来医院。 王磊坦言，医疗健康创业会比其他行业要难，“这不仅仅是有多少钱的事情，还要沉得下心，耐得住寂寞慢慢去做。”</div>
	<div class="translation" id="13">According to media reports, due to the previous large-scale influx of capital into Internet medicine, resulting in the current serious problem of product homogenization, the investment boom gradually receded, capital into a wait and see period. According to data from the Centre for Management Research at Ellison Hospital in Hong Kong, a large number of Internet medical companies have died within one year of their establishment, and about 20 per cent of the start-up Internet medical companies have ceased to exist. However, just as most internet healthcare companies struggle to finance rounds A and B, several segment leaders are still gaining traction. It seems that the Internet can not be a medical entrepreneurship "swarm", but to look at the market demand, sink down to do special, do deep. Yuyue made a capital contribution of 12 million yuan, accounting for 40 percent of the registered capital, and Kyushu Tong Instrument Company made a capital contribution of 18 million yuan, accounting for 60 percent of the registered capital. In recent years, with the state's policy support in medical information, electronic, integrated supply chain management system gradually into all levels of hospitals. The cooperation between Yuyue and Kyushu Tong is precisely aimed at the needs of the market, helping hospitals to build advanced supply chain management system, and using this as an opportunity to seek more cooperation. Unlike many internet healthcare companies, iBaby has been focused on the internet obstetrics vertical since its inception, working both as a mother and a doctor. Pregnant mothers are not only entitled to free 24-hour and one-on-one consultation with a doctor in charge, but are also entitled to paid, directed medical consultation. At the doctor's end, iBaby breaks geographical boundaries by organizing experts to give microlectures, such as online lectures, peer-to-peer exchanges, and case discussions, to doctors at the grass-roots level. At present, the doctor side opened three sections, respectively, for doctors to continue education, doctors social and doctors for help. <span class="highlighted">Services include online learning, case discussions, academic exchanges, social networking platforms with hospitals and doctors in departments, legal assistance for doctor-patient relationships or personal life, and support for entrepreneurship.</span> CEO Wang Lei recently said Ali Health was "willing to sink in" to take down health big data, according to media reports. Internet companies, data companies lack professionalism in the same entry on the writing methods are not uniform. Ali's current layout in the field of health care is divided into three sections, namely Ali Health, Tmall Medicine Hall and Alipay Future Hospital. "It's not just a matter of how much money you have," Wang admits. "It's a matter of getting down and being able to live with the loneliness and do it slowly."</div>
	<div class="translation" id="13">Media revealed that the deluge of capital that swamped online health care resulted in the severe product homogeneity problem we see today. The investment boom is waning gradually. Capital has entered a wait-and-see period. Figures from Hong Kong Ailibi Hospital Management Research Center revealed that many online health care companies close down within the first year of incorporation; approximately 20% of newly founded online health care enterprises no longer exist. However, while most Internet health care companies were struggling to choose between Series A or Series B financing, a number of leading companies in specialized sectors were still able to attract capital. It seems that "rushing headlong" into the Industry healthcare sector is not the wisest option. One must accurately assess market requirements, be patient, and improve the professionalism and depth of services provided. Yuyue contributed 12.0000 million dollars, comprising 40% of the registered capital, while Jointown Pharmaceutical provided 18.0000 million dollars for 60% of the registered capital. In recent years, thanks to national policy support in terms of medical informatization, electronic and integrated supply chain management systems have been gradually introduced into different classes of hospitals. The partnership between Yuyue and Jointown Pharmaceutical aims at meeting market demands and helping hospital establish an advanced supply chain management system. The partnership is also an opportunity to seek additional partnerships. Unlike many Internet health care companies obsessed with scale and extensive coverage, iBaby focused on the vertical industry of obstetrics from the very beginning, channeling their efforts toward supporting both pregnant mothers and their physicians. Pregnant mothers can receive 24-hours one-on-one consultation with a specialist physician for free. They can also pay for personal consultation with a specified physician. At the doctors' end, iBaby has broken down regional restrictions by way of organizing experts to carry out webinars, peer exchanges, case discussions and other mini-seminars. Currently, three segments have been set up at the doctor's end, namely, continuing education for doctors, social networking for doctors, and help for doctors. <span class="highlighted">The contents provided include online learning, medical case studies, and academic exchange; social networking platform between physicians of the same hospital or same departments; and doctor-patient relationships or legal assistance necessary for personal lifestyles, entrepreneurship support, and other services.</span> Media report that CEO Wang Lei expressed that Alibaba Health is "willing to settle down" and takeover the Big Data analytics for health. Online businesses and data companies lack professionalism, and were unable to achieve uniformity in the terminologies of identical keywords. Alibaba has structured its presence in the health care industry into three segments, namely Alibaba Health, Tmall Pharmacy, and Alipay's Future Hospital. Wang Lei disclosed that starting a medical healthcare company is more challenging when compared to other sectors. "This is not just about making money. You must be patient and get used to loneliness to do this properly."</div>
	<div class="translation" id="13">According to media reports, due to the large surge of capital into IOMT (internet of medical things), which resulted in a serious issue of product consistency. With the investment boom slowing down, investments have entered a wait-and-see period. According to data from the Hong Kong Alec Hospital Management Research Center, a large number of venture IOMT companies have gone out of business within a year of starting, and about 20% of them have disappeared. However, just as most of the IOMT companies struggled in the A or B round of financing, there were several leading companies in the niche areas who were still able to obtain sufficient capital. From this observation, one can say that these IOMT cannot "simply all come about doing the same thing", but to watch the market demand and do their due diligence. Jiangsu Yuyue Mdcl Eqpmnt & Spply Co Ltd. invested 120 million yuan, accounting for 40% of the registered capital, and Jiuzhou Tongji Machinery Co., Ltd. invested 180 million yuan, accounting for 60% of the registered capital. In recent years, the digitalized and integrated supply chain management system is slowly being utilized in various levels of hospitals thanks to country's support in the form of policies on the information of IOMT. The cooperation between Jiangsu Yuyue Mdcl Eqpmnt & Spply Co Ltd. and Jiuzhou Tongji Machinery Co., Ltd. targets the market demands, supports hospitals implement advanced supply chain management systems and use this as an opportunity to seek further collaboration. Unlike many IOMT companies, iBaby has been focusing on the vertical field of obstetrics for the Internet from the very beginning and has been working with both mothers and doctors. "On a 24-hour basis, pregnant mothers can not only receive free one-on-one consultations with qualified doctors, and also receive paid medical diagnosis." From the doctor's side, iBaby allows them to provide lectures, communicate better with peers, discuss cases beyond the geographic barriers. Currently, the doctors can set up three sections for doctors to continue their education, communicate with other doctors, and request help from doctors. <span class="highlighted">This provides business support for online learning, case discussions, academic exchanges; social networking with hospitals and doctors in the same department, and necessary legal support relating to doctor-patient relationship.</span> According to media reports, CEO Wang Lei recently stated that AliHealth "has decided" to compile the healthcare data. Tech companies and data companies lack professionalism and cannot cooperate. Alibaba's current presence in the healthcare industry is divided into three sections: AliHealth, Tmall Online Pharmacy, and Alipay's "Future Hospital" program. Wang Lei admitted that business in the healthcare is more difficult than other industries. “It is not simply having enough money, but to be able to persevere and work step by step."</div>

During the evening of the 11th, Zhang Donghong, his wife, and dozens of other family members and friends stood before this new television and witnessed how his daughter started a miraculous spree that brought her from the brink of being dropped out of the competition to a medal winning score. On the day of the competition, Zhang Binbin had a mid to low ranking at one point, and a spot in the final appeared extremely remote. Parents, family, and friends did not give up, and continued to watch to live stream. When the other athletes completed their firing, Zhang Binbin's rank kept rising until she secured the right to compete in the finals. Everyone at her home exploded in a great cheer. In the finals, Zhang Binbin, who again fell behind in the rankings at one point, became increasingly steady as she fired the last few shots. She finished just 0.2 points behind the champion, clinching the silver medal. Across her 16-year shooting career, Zhang Binbin, who is 27-year old this year, brushed past this hard-won silver medal on several occasions. The mother, Zhang Xiaolong, told the reporter that when everyone was still hesitant, Zhang Binbin found several "young persuaders" from the same village. The "little lobbyists" are the kids from the same family participated the training by recommendation at hat time, including the cousin of Zhang Binbin. Not long after entering the Xiamen team, Zhang Binbin once again actively returned to study at a school in Xiang'an due to family difficulties and other reasons. Zhang Binbin returned to Xiamen Team after being repeatedly persuaded by her first coach Zhang Yajie. After joining the provincial team, Zhang Binbin, who took a long time to advance to the national team, returned home at one point because she saw no hope. This visit included more than just Coach Zhang Yajie. Official leaders and coaches from the Xiamen Shooting Shejian Sports Center and Fujian Provincial Team also came by and successfully persuaded Zhang Binbin to return to the provincial team. Just like the competition yesterday, this daughter of Xiamen persisted and once again turned the tables in her shooting career. "Every coach has different way of picking team members. At the time, I noticed that Binbin has really nice hands, and fell in love with them immediately." Zhang Donghong also recalled that although his daughter's performance was not the best at the group training test, the number of rounds she shot was very stable. This was also a key factor why Zhang Binbin attracted the attention of her coach. During training, the farm girl Zhang Binbin was so committed that she left a lasting impression with Zhang Yajie. He recollected that more than one year after Zhang Binbin joined the Xiamen shooting team, the team conducted a standing posture rifle firing training. Team members were required to stand still for half an hour. Zhang Xiaolong told the reporter that her daughter is a quiet and obedient child and has loved drawing and making her own toys since a young age. "Originally, I stayed at home to tailor some clothes, sewing and mending them as needed. Binbin would sit by the corner, collecting the scrap fabrics to make her own fabric doll." She said that her daughter would often sew and make her own toys. Coupled with the fact that she was good at drawing, she was able to create a lifelike face and clothing for the dolls she made. As an athlete, Zhang Binbin spends little time with family, and could only return home during weekends and public holidays. Usually, they communicate using the telephone. Her parents said that whether when meeting in person or talking on the phone, Zhang Binbin seldom said she found things difficult. More often than not, she would chat about happy things with parents. Since they hardly see their daughter, the parents carefully preserved the artwork that their girl has made as a child and the glories that she had later won. Zhang Xiaolong showed the reporter the cartoon artwork his daughter created. "If she didn't become a archer, she would probably continue to draw." There is a cabinet located at the second floor living room in Zhang Binbin's home that is filled with the plaques, medals, and certificates that she had won. Zhang Donghong displayed the medals and awards neatly, and kept all the certificates in a folder. "These are the honors Binbin has received over the years on the basis of her hard work and dedication. All of us cherish them."</div>

However her parents and close friends did not give up on her as they kept their eyes on the text of the broadcast. Upon seeing other players finishing and where they were ranked, they saw Binbin's name go up the rank and secured a seat in the finals, when the families and friends burst in cheers at home. In the finals, she was on the bottom end of the ranking but her last few shots got more stable and won the silver medal with only 0.2 points behind the champion. For Zhang Binbin who is already 27, it was a hard-fought silver medal in her 16 years of her shooting career. Zhang's mother, Xiaolong told the reporters that when they felt hesitant about her doing this, Zhang Binbin brought a group of "young kids" from the same village to persuade her parents. The "young kids" were from the same village who were also recommended to participate in the training at the same time. Among them was Zhang Binbin's cousin. However, shortly after joining the Xiamen team, Zhang Binbin decided to go back to school in Xiang'an to study due to family hardships. But after the coach Zhang Yajie, kept convincing her, she returned to the Xiamen team again. After being in the provincial team, Zhang Binbin once again failed to get in the national team. As she could not see hope in getting in, she returned home once again. This time, not only coach Zhang, but also the managers and coaches of the Xiamen Shooting and Archery Sports Center and the Fujian provincial team came to her home to persuade Zhang Binbin to return to the provincial team. Like yesterday's game, she persisted and overcame the hurdles in her shooting career. "The way a coach decides who makes the team is different. However for me, I knew she was it when I saw Zhang Binbin's hands." Zhang Donhong also remembered that during the test in the training, despite her scores not being the best, her points were very consistent which was the reason the coaches were fond of Zhang Binbin. In the process of training Zhang Binbin, Zhang Yajie remembered clearly the input provided by this farm girl. He recalls that around 1 year after Zhang Binbin joined the Xiamen Shooting team, the team had a endurance training exercise where they were not allowed to move for half an hour. Zhang Xiaolong told the reporters that her daughter was always a quiet and obedient girl who liked to draw and play with homemade toys when she was small. "When I would sew and repair clothes at home, Binbin would use the scrap pieces and make a doll herself. She said that her daughter would often sew her own toys. As she also liked to draw, the facial expression and the clothes of the dolls she made looked really good. As an athlete, Zhang Binbin saw her family less and less, and would only go back home during the holidays, and usually contacted each other by phone. Her parents said that regardless of being together or on the phone, she would seldom talk about her hardship and would mostly talk about something happy with her parents. As they aren't able to see their daughter often, they make sure to carefully keep the drawings she made when she was little at home. Zhang Xiaolong showed a comic drawn by her daughter to the reporter and said "if she didn't become a shooter, she would have probably continued drawing." In the living room on the second floor of Zhang Binbin's house, there is a cupboard full of medals, and certificates she has won. Zhang Donghong arranged the medals neatly, and the certificates in a folder. “These are the result of Binbin's hard work in these 10 years and so, and are very precious to us."</div>

Upon seeing other players finishing and where they were ranked, they saw Binbin's name go up the rank and secured a seat in the finals, when the families and friends burst in cheers at home. In the finals, she was on the bottom end of the ranking but her last few shots got more stable and won the silver medal with only 0.2 points behind the champion. For Zhang Binbin who is already 27, it was a hard-fought silver medal in her 16 years of her shooting career. Zhang's mother, Xiaolong told the reporters that when they felt hesitant about her doing this, Zhang Binbin brought a group of "young kids" from the same village to persuade her parents. The "young kids" were from the same village who were also recommended to participate in the training at the same time. Among them was Zhang Binbin's cousin. However, shortly after joining the Xiamen team, Zhang Binbin decided to go back to school in Xiang'an to study due to family hardships. But after the coach Zhang Yajie, kept convincing her, she returned to the Xiamen team again. After being in the provincial team, Zhang Binbin once again failed to get in the national team. As she could not see hope in getting in, she returned home once again. This time, not only coach Zhang, but also the managers and coaches of the Xiamen Shooting and Archery Sports Center and the Fujian provincial team came to her home to persuade Zhang Binbin to return to the provincial team. Like yesterday's game, she persisted and overcame the hurdles in her shooting career. "The way a coach decides who makes the team is different. However for me, I knew she was it when I saw Zhang Binbin's hands." Zhang Donhong also remembered that during the test in the training, despite her scores not being the best, her points were very consistent which was the reason the coaches were fond of Zhang Binbin. In the process of training Zhang Binbin, Zhang Yajie remembered clearly the input provided by this farm girl. He recalls that around 1 year after Zhang Binbin joined the Xiamen Shooting team, the team had a endurance training exercise where they were not allowed to move for half an hour. Zhang Xiaolong told the reporters that her daughter was always a quiet and obedient girl who liked to draw and play with homemade toys when she was small. "When I would sew and repair clothes at home, Binbin would use the scrap pieces and make a doll herself. She said that her daughter would often sew her own toys. As she also liked to draw, the facial expression and the clothes of the dolls she made looked really good. As an athlete, Zhang Binbin saw her family less and less, and would only go back home during the holidays, and usually contacted each other by phone. Her parents said that regardless of being together or on the phone, she would seldom talk about her hardship and would mostly talk about something happy with her parents. As they aren't able to see their daughter often, they make sure to carefully keep the drawings she made when she was little at home. Zhang Xiaolong showed a comic drawn by her daughter to the reporter and said "if she didn't become a shooter, she would have probably continued drawing." <span class="highlighted">In the living room on the second floor of Zhang Binbin's house, there is a cupboard full of medals, and certificates she has won.</span> Zhang Donghong arranged the medals neatly, and the certificates in a folder. “These are the result of Binbin's hard work in these 10 years and so, and are very precious to us."</div>

	<div class="translation" id="17">Zhang Binbin, a daughter of Xiamen, had "wonderful hand posture" and experienced multiple "reversals" during her career as a shooter. Zhang Donghong, a resident at Dongyuan Village at Xiang'an District in Xiamen, just swapped his old 29-inch television for a large 65-inch set several days ago. This daughter of a common farmer is Zhang Binbin, who just won a silver medal for China in the 50 meter rifle three positions in the Rio Olympics. During the evening of the 11th, Zhang Donghong, his wife, and dozens of other family members and friends stood before this new television and witnessed how his daughter started a miraculous spree that brought her from the brink of being dropped out of the competition to a medal winning score. On the day of the competition, Zhang Binbin had a mid to low ranking at one point, and a spot in the final appeared extremely remote. Parents, family, and friends did not give up, and continued to watch to live stream. When the other athletes completed their firing, Zhang Binbin's rank kept rising until she secured the right to compete in the finals. Everyone at her home exploded in a great cheer. In the finals, Zhang Binbin, who again fell behind in the rankings at one point, became increasingly steady as she fired the last few shots. She finished just 0.2 points behind the champion, clinching the silver medal. <span class="highlighted">Across her 16-year shooting career, Zhang Binbin, who is 27-year old this year, brushed past this hard-won silver medal on several occasions.</span> The mother, Zhang Xiaolong, told the reporter that when everyone was still hesitant, Zhang Binbin found several "young persuaders" from the same village. The "little lobbyists" are the kids from the same family participated the training by recommendation at hat time, including the cousin of Zhang Binbin. Not long after entering the Xiamen team, Zhang Binbin once again actively returned to study at a school in Xiang'an due to family difficulties and other reasons. Zhang Binbin returned to Xiamen Team after being repeatedly persuaded by her first coach Zhang Yajie. After joining the provincial team, Zhang Binbin, who took a long time to advance to the national team, returned home at one point because she saw no hope. This visit included more than just Coach Zhang Yajie. Official leaders and coaches from the Xiamen Shooting Shejian Sports Center and Fujian Provincial Team also came by and successfully persuaded Zhang Binbin to return to the provincial team. Just like the competition yesterday, this daughter of Xiamen persisted and once again turned the tables in her shooting career. "Every coach has different way of picking team members. At the time, I noticed that Binbin has really nice hands, and fell in love with them immediately." Zhang Donghong also recalled that although his daughter's performance was not the best at the group training test, the number of rounds she shot was very stable. This was also a key factor why Zhang Binbin attracted the attention of her coach. During training, the farm girl Zhang Binbin was so committed that she left a lasting impression with Zhang Yajie. He recollected that more than one year after Zhang Binbin joined the Xiamen shooting team, the team conducted a standing posture rifle firing training. Team members were required to stand still for half an hour. Zhang Xiaolong told the reporter that her daughter is a quiet and obedient child and has loved drawing and making her own toys since a young age. "Originally, I stayed at home to tailor some clothes, sewing and mending them as needed. Binbin would sit by the corner, collecting the scrap fabrics to make her own fabric doll." She said that her daughter would often sew and make her own toys. Coupled with the fact that she was good at drawing, she was able to create a lifelike face and clothing for the dolls she made. As an athlete, Zhang Binbin spends little time with family, and could only return home during weekends and public holidays. Usually, they communicate using the telephone. Her parents said that whether when meeting in person or talking on the phone, Zhang Binbin seldom said she found things difficult. More often than not, she would chat about happy things with parents. Since they hardly see their daughter, the parents carefully preserved the artwork that their girl has made as a child and the glories that she had later won. Zhang Xiaolong showed the reporter the cartoon artwork his daughter created. "If she didn't become a archer, she would probably continue to draw." There is a cabinet located at the second floor living room in Zhang Binbin's home that is filled with the plaques, medals, and certificates that she had won. Zhang Donghong displayed the medals and awards neatly, and kept all the certificates in a folder. "These are the honors Binbin has received over the years on the basis of her hard work and dedication. All of us cherish them."</div>

	<div class="translation" id="20">Grecia is an adorable female toucan that exudes a tropical feel. The story of Grecia the toucan has been known early on in the Central American country of Costa Rica. In the press release on August 30th, Grecia who recovered from the surgery showed off her new prosthetic 3D printed beak to the public. The toucan whose beak was hacked off by humans and was dying a year and half ago is now reborn. This day not only confirms that she is 100% healthy, but also is a day when she will be relocated to a luxurious cage and a day for those who care about her to be able to see her. Grecia was a bit shy after moving to her new home but became more lively as she played in the water and ate grapes with her new beak. The engineering specialist did not newly paint the 3D printed beak to serve as a reminder to people of what she went through, thus leaving it in the original white color of the 3D printing material. The outer layer of the beak features a thin wall of keratin, and the inside is generally hollow and is only supported by several thin bone struts. Despite the interior being reinforced, the toucan's beak is still frail and can break when damaged. With the collaboration with the animal rescue center, bird specialists, and a US 3D printing company, the group was able to create several "trial versions" to identify and finally create "the perfect one". Grecia can now skillfully use her new beak to drink water, eat, and even pick up small grains. "The design of the final product took around 2 months and the printing only took 4-5 hours." <span class="highlighted">The president of SG3D Printing, Thomas Lange explained to Xinhua International during an interview that, "3D printing is not a technology of the future but has already stepped in to our lives".</span> In January 2015, a bloodied toucan (Grecia) was found on a farm in Grecia, Alajuela Province located in central Costa Rica. The beak was brutally hacked off by a group of youngsters. She could not eat at all and was in critical condition. After the media covered the story of Grecia's tragic situation, it triggered a wave of opposition on animal cruelty in and outside of Costa Rica. People have since called out for a stricter animal protection law and for harsher penalties for animal abuse. People proactively came together to do their best to help Grecia recover and regain her life before being injured. Chuck Hall who is the inventor of 3D printing was also involved in the design of Grecia's beak. "Grecia's situation was a very special one as there was less than 1 cm of the upper jaw left, which caused many difficulties in attaching the beak." "We first scanned Grecia then designed an extended cap that was a bit longer than the remnant beak, then glued the prosthetic beak". Lange told the reporters of Xinhua International that "By doing so, we can prevent further injury for Grecia". Before installing the prosthetic beak, the staff had to keep Grecia clean everyday to prevent infections. The story of Grecia the toucan travelled the distance and touched John Hoffman who is a producer at Discovery News Channel and Paul Heredia who is a famous documentary director. They filmed bits and pieces of the installation of Grecia's new beak to make a documentary called "Toucan Nation" which was aired on Animal Planet this month. The documentary "Toucan Nation" shows how a small Toucan inspired a nation to make changes and citizens to get involved to stop animal cruelty.</div>
	<div class="translation" id="20">Gracia is a cute female toucan with the scent of the jungle about her. In the Central American country of Costa Rica, the toucan Gracia and its story are extremely well-known. The August 10 press conference finally revealed Gracia after recovering from the operation, displaying its brand new 3D-printed plastic beak. This toucan whose upper beak was broken by someone, and which was on the brink of death, has now finally received a new lease of life. This is the day that the bird has reached 100% recovery and the day when it could be moved to a luxurious bird house and meet its human friends who have been caring for it. Gracia appears to be rather shy after moving to her new home, but quickly revealed her lively side, playing in the pool of water and using her new beak to eat grapes. To remind people of the abuse it once suffered, the technicians did not color its new beak, but kept it white, the original color of the 3D printing material. The external layer of the beak is a thin keratin sheath. The beak is hollow and only reinforced by thin, criss-crossing supporting struts of bone. Although reinforced internally, the toucan's beak is still fragile, and will crack when it is harmed. The animal aid center, an ornithologist, and a 3D printing company from the United States are working together, making several "experimental beaks" for Gracia before creating the "perfect beak" that best suits the bird. Now Gracia has become proficient in using her beak to drink, eat, and even pick up fine seed grains. "The design of the final product took about two months; printing took just four to five hours." <span class="highlighted">"3D printing is not for next generation. It has become part of our life." Thomas Lange, President of SG3D told the  Xinhua News Agency.</span> On January 2015, Gracia the toucan was found, bleeding from its mouth, by a person in a farm at Gracia, Alajuela Province in central Costa Rica. At the time, its upper beak was cruelly broken by a group of youths. It could not eat and was dying. Once reported in mass media, Gracia's sad state initiated a wave of outcry against animal abuse in and outside Costa Rica. The public requested more rigorous animal protection laws to be established, and punishment for abusers to be stepped out. People came forward voluntarily, and did the best they could to help Grecia regain its life prior to the injury. Even Chuck Hull, the inventor of 3D printing technology, also contributed towards the design of Gracia's upper beak. "Gracia's condition is quite unique. Less than 1 cm of its upper beak has remained, making it difficult to install a new beak." "We first scanned Gracia and then designed and manufactured an extended prosthetic that is slightly longer than its remaining upper beak. The prosthetic is then glued to its upper beak." "This will help reduce further invasive injury on Grecia," Lange told a XInhua international news reporter. Prior to installing the prosthetics, workers cleaned the broken beak for Gracia everyday to prevent infections. Thousands of miles away, the story of Gracia the toucan has moved renowned documentary filmmaker Paula Heredia and investigative journalist John Hoffman. Toucan Nation is a documentary that recorded in detail the process of fitting a new beak for Grecia, which was broadcast on Animal Planet this month. The documentary Toucan Nation showed how a small toucan bird could change a country and encourage every citizen to participate in the movement against animal abuse.</div>
	<div class="translation" id="20">Gracia is a budding female toucan with the scent of a tropical rainforest. In the Central American country of Costa Rica, the toucan Gracia and its story have long been a household name. At a press conference on August 10, Gracia, who is recovering from surgery, finally appeared to show off her brand-new, 3D printed plastic beak. The dying toucan, which had its beak snapped off a year and a half ago, has been given a new lease of life. This day heralds not only its 100 per cent return to health, but also its move into the luxurious aviary and its meeting with human friends who care about it. Gracia, who had just entered her new home, was a little shy, but soon became active, wallowing in the basin and eating the grapes with her new beak. To remind people of the damage it has suffered, instead of painting its new beak, technicians have kept the original white of the 3D printing material. The beak is covered with a thin, horny sheath that is hollow inside, with only a few thin, bone-supporting poles interlaced. Despite this internal reinforcement, the toucan's beak is still fragile and will break when it is damaged. The Animal Rescue Center, ornithologists and an American 3D printing company worked together to create several "experimental beaks" for Gracia, finally creating the "perfect beak" for her. Gracia is now adept at using her new beak to drink, eat and even pick up tiny grains. "The final product took about two months to design and only four or five hours to print." <span class="highlighted">"3D printing is not the technology of the future, it has really come into your life and mine," Thomas Langer, chairman of SG3D printing company, told Xinhua International.</span> Gracia, a toucan covered in blood, was discovered on a farm in Gracia, in the central Alajuela province of Costa Rica, in January 2015. At that time, its beak was brutally broken by a group of young people, it was completely unable to eat, life-threatening. The tragedy in Gracia has caused a flurry of calls against animal cruelty in and around Costa Rica after media reports. There have been calls for stricter animal protection laws and greater penalties for abusers. People came spontaneously and did their best to help Gracia get back to life as much as possible before the injury. Even Chuck Hull, the inventor of 3D printing technology, was involved in the design of Gracia's upper beak. "The case of Gracia is unique in that the remaining part of its upper beak is less than one centimetre, which makes it difficult to install a new beak," he said. "We scanned Gracia and then designed and made an extended prosthesis that was slightly longer than the rest of her upper beak. "This will reduce further invasive damage to Gracia," Langer told Xinhua International. Before installing the prosthesis, staff had to clean up Gracia's beak every day to prevent infection. Thousands of miles away, the story of Toucan Gracia moved famous documentary filmmaker Paula Heredia and Discovery News producer John Hoffman. They chronicled the installation of Gracia's new beak and recorded a documentary, "Land of the Toucans," which was shown on Animal Planet this month. The documentary "Land of Toucans" shows how a tiny toucan can make a country change for itself, and how it can involve its citizens in the fight against animal cruelty.</div>

	<div class="translation" id="21">Qingdao is the 12th city in the nation and the first in Shandong Province to implement the pilot program for paying for the use and trading of emissions rights. On the 11th, many companies submitted emission rights purchase applications at the Qingdao Emissions Trading Center. Those who successfully applied for the rights will start paying a usage fee. The imminent completion of this first trade also marks the official launch of the pilot program for the trading of emission rights in Qingdao. This will also be the first emission rights trade in the Province as well as the first city-level  emission rights trade in the nation. In the morning of the 11th, Zhao Xiuping, general manager of Qingdao Shuangtao Jingxi Chemical Industry (Group) came to the Qingdao City Emissions Trading Center to submit an application to purchase emission rights. <span class="highlighted">This corporation, situated in the factory area of Old Town of Qingdao, stopped its production lines at the end of last year, and was moved, using environment-friendly means, to a new plant area in Pingdu.</span> Zhao Xiuping submitted the application form, environmental impact report, and other materials for the construction project. The Qingdao City Emissions Reserve and Trading Service Center began preliminary reviews of the application materials. According to the collection criteria determined by Qingdao's pricing, finance and other departments, the  initial usage fee for emissions rights is currently estimated at approximately RMB641,200. Staff will complete checking and ratification within seven working days. The first transaction, which will be completed soon, also marks the formal initiation of the Qingdao Emissions Trading Pilot Project. This will also be the first emissions trading in the province and the first city-level emissions trading in the entire country. Zhao Xiuping said, "Presently, enterprises have invested RMB400 million in environmental protection. On the surface, this seems an enormous amount, but it has a profound impact on both the operational and management philosophy of enterprises as well as social benefit, and has provided room for innovative management by enterprises. On that day, Qingdao Sifang Xincheng Zhizhuo Coach Components Co., Ltd. also came to apply for and purchase emission rights for the project to produce 4,200 pieces of interior accessories and components for high speed train and electric multiple units. This project is initiated by a mechanical processing company. The company is applying for an initial emissions as chemical oxygen demand (COD) of 0.514 tons/year and ammonia nitrogen (NOX) of 0.052 tons/year. Paying for the use and trading of air pollutant emissions rights is for the city's key power and heat production and supply industrial enterprises. Existing polluting companies that have received a bad rating prior to January 1, 2016 will be temporarily exempt from the usage fee. "Paying for emission rights does not mean gaining the right to generate illegal emissions. The payer may not emit waste as they like." Deputy Director Han Hongyan of the Qingdao Environmental Protection Bureau explained that illegal emissions or emissions that exceed specified limits shall be subject to penalties according to relevant laws. Violating companies will not be able to purchase emission rights to avoid punishments. In another word, we should fight against environmental offense and  excessive discharge by enterprises with serious legal action to protect our environment and public health. Enterprises are now more enthusiastic about pollution treatment because of their own interests; limited emission rights are valued, and emission of pollutants has decreased. Driven by economic interest, reducing emission of pollutants will shift from mandatory acts imposed by the government to conscious corporate market behavior. Thus, the goal of protecting the environment and nature as well as ensuring public health will be achieved. The right to discharge pollutants, or "emission rights", are a right to emit pollutants, i.e., polluters, within a quota allocated by the government, enjoy the right to discharge pollutants into the environment according to the law. This right is in essence, the right polluters have on the ownership, use and profit of existing resources in the environment. In the next step, under the pretext of keeping total emissions within the allowable emission volume, various internal sources of pollution shall use currency exchange to modulate emissions. Emissions trading was first proposed by the US economist Dales in 1968. In the 1970s, the US made use of this to manage sources of atmospheric and river pollution. Pilot programs were initiated since 2007. Currently, the program is being fully implemented at Zhejiang, Jiangsu, and other 14 provinces (in districts and cities).</div>
	<div class="translation" id="21">Qingdao is the 12th in China and the first pilot city of paid use and trading of emission rights in Shandong Province. 11, a number of enterprises came to Qingdao Municipal Emission Trading Center to submit applications for the purchase of emission rights, purchase acceptance will pay a fee.

On the morning of November 11, Zhao Xiuping, general manager of Qingdao Shuangtao Fine Chemical Industry (Group) Co., Ltd. came to Qingdao Emission Trading Center to submit the application for emission rights. <span class="highlighted">The enterprise is located in the old city of Qingdao plant at the end of last year to stop production, environmental protection moved to the new plant in Pingdu.</span> After Zhao Xiuping submitted the application form, the environmental impact statement of the construction project and other materials, the Qingdao Municipal Emission Right Reserve and Trading Service Center began the preliminary examination of the application materials. According to Qingdao prices, finance and other departments to determine the collection standards, the current estimated initial sewage right to use about 644.12 million yuan, staff will be completed within seven working days to verify. The transaction is about to complete the first single also indicates that Qingdao emission trading pilot work officially kicked off, will also be the province's emission trading first single and the first national city-level emissions trading. Zhao Xiuping said: At present, enterprises have invested 400 million in environmental protection, a huge amount on the surface, but the concept of business management, social benefits have a great impact on the enterprise innovation and management has also opened up space. On the same day, Qingdao Sifang Xinchengzhizhuo Bus Accessories Co., Ltd. has also come to the annual output of 4,200 high-speed rail and EMU interior accessories projects to purchase emission rights. The project belongs to the mechanical processing enterprises, the application for the initial emission of chemical oxygen demand (COD) 0.514 tons / year, ammonia nitrogen (NOX) 0.052 tons / year. Air pollutant emission rights paid use and trade for the city's electricity, thermal production and supply of key industrial enterprises. Existing units that have obtained an EIA prior to January 1, 2016, will not be charged a toll fee for the time being. "Paid access to emission permits is not the same as access to the power of illegal discharge of pollutants, and can not be arbitrarily discharged pollutants." Han Hongyan, deputy director of Qingdao Municipal Environmental Protection Bureau, said that if illegal discharge, excessive discharge should still be punished in accordance with the relevant regulations, it is impossible to allow illegal enterprises through the purchase of pollution rights to avoid punishment. In other words, through legal means to crack down on environmental violations, and severely punish enterprises for excessive pollution, so as to protect the environment and protect public health. Now enterprises for their own interests, improve the enthusiasm of pollution control, cherish the limited emission rights, reducing the emission of pollutants. Driven by the economic benefits, reducing the emission of pollutants will change from the government's compulsory behavior to the enterprise's conscious market behavior, so as to truly achieve the goal of protecting the environment, protecting nature and protecting public health. Emission right, also known as "emission right", is the right to discharge pollutants, which refers to the right of the emitter to discharge pollutants into the environment within the quota allocated by the government according to law. This right is essentially the right of the polluter to possess, use and benefit from the environmental capacity resources. Next, under the premise that the total amount of pollutants discharged does not exceed the permitted amount, the amount of pollutants discharged is adjusted by means of currency exchange between the internal sources of pollution. Since the emission trading was put forward by American economist Dales in 1968, it has been applied to the management of air and river pollution sources in the United States since the 1970s. China began to carry out pilot projects in 2007, and 14 provinces (autonomous regions and municipalities), including Zhejiang and Jiangsu, have been fully implemented.</div>

The staff will process and verify it within 7 business days. The first trading done represents that the carbon emission trading pilot program has officially started, and will be the first in the province to introduce the emission trading scheme at the city-level. Zhao Xiuping mentioned that he has invested RMB 400 million on corporate environmental responsibility. Despite being a large amount of money put into this, it greatly impacts the company's philosophy, social responsibility, and also opens up a new level of innovation management. On the same day, Qingdao Sifang Xincheng Zhizhuo Coach Parts Co., Ltd. also came to purchase emission permits for their annual production of 4,200 pieces of high-speed rail and EMU (Electrical Multiple Unit) interior parts. This project was for the machining companies, with initial emission amount of 0.514 ton/yr of COD, and 0.052 ton/yr of NOX on their application. The carbon emission trading is an important business to support electricity and heat for the city. The carbon credits obtained from EIA before January 1, 2016 will not be charged with the usage fee for the time being. "Purchasing an emission permit does not grant permission to freely discharge illegal pollutants." Han Hongyan, the Deputy Director of the Environmental Protection Bureau of Qingdao stated the those who discharge illegal pollutants and excessive pollutants will still be punished according to the regulation; those discharging illegal discharge of pollutants and excessive discharge of pollutants will still have to be punished in accordance with relevant regulations, and companies will not be able to purchase emission permits to avoid punishment for illegal or excessive discharges. Basically, through legal measures and being stringent on environmental violations and to punish companies for excessive discharges, we will be able to protect the environment and the health of the public. Companies have now put their focus on managing emissions for their own benefit and appreciate limiting the emission amount which has lead to a reduction of pollutants being discharged. With the economic benefits being a factor, the government's bold action has lead to company's to react to take action on reducing emissions. This will all lead to protecting the environment, nature, and the health of the public. The right to emit pollutants, also known as “emissions permit”. It refers to the right of emitters to discharge pollutants to the environment within the limits allocated by the government. This type of right limits the footprint of the polluters in the environment and a right to gain revenue. The next step, assuming that the discharged pollutant does not exceed the limit is to control the emission amount  through carbon emission trading. Emissions trading was proposed by American economist John Dales back in 1968. Since the 1970s in the 20th Century, the United States has applied it to control pollution in the atmosphere and river. China has been doing trials since 2007, and has implemented it in 14 provinces (in regions and cities) including Zhejiang and Jiangsu.</div>

Inland customs regulations stipulate that diamond are not necessities nor are used by the travelers during their trips, and would therefore be regarded as a merchandise and must be declared when entering or leaving the country. Failure to do so would be considered an act of trafficking which is punishable with a prison sentence for serious offenses.</div>
	<div class="translation" id="23">Hong Kong's Oriental Daily reported on August 12, the current mainland diamond sales are alleged to exist in three major problems, including false diamond clarity to push up prices, false diamond weight, after-sale insecurity and so on. And Antwerp is one of the world's largest diamond trading centres, with local artisans renowned for their diamond-cutting skills, and the diamonds sold are highly qualified and popular with mainland women. "A small cloth bag, held in the palm of your hand, a light handful, worth nearly a million dollars," said a woman surnamed Liu, who was involved in the purchase of diamonds, describing her experience in Antwerp in June this year to the mainland media. <span class="highlighted">She said she hid the diamonds in her underwear, carried them to the toilet and shower for days on end, and was nervous about walking and sleeping.</span> She claims that diamonds bought in Antwerp cost about $55,000 per carat, while diamonds of the same quality retail at about $111,000 in Xiamen. A few days ago, she sold all the diamonds on her behalf at a 20% mark-up, making a profit of $200,000 at a time. According to the Mainland Customs, diamonds are not articles or necessities for passengers in their itinerary and therefore fall into the category of goods. They are required to be declared at the time of entry and exit. Otherwise, they may be classified as smuggled goods and are liable to imprisonment in serious cases.</div>

	<div class="translation" id="25">Grecia is an adorable female toucan that exudes a tropical feel. The story of Grecia the toucan has been known early on in the Central American country of Costa Rica. In the press release on August 30th, Grecia who recovered from the surgery showed off her new prosthetic 3D printed beak to the public. The toucan whose beak was hacked off by humans and was dying a year and half ago is now reborn. <span class="highlighted">This day not only confirms that she is 100% healthy, but also is a day when she will be relocated to a luxurious cage and a day for those who care about her to be able to see her.</span> Grecia was a bit shy after moving to her new home but became more lively as she played in the water and ate grapes with her new beak. The engineering specialist did not newly paint the 3D printed beak to serve as a reminder to people of what she went through, thus leaving it in the original white color of the 3D printing material. The outer layer of the beak features a thin wall of keratin, and the inside is generally hollow and is only supported by several thin bone struts. Despite the interior being reinforced, the toucan's beak is still frail and can break when damaged. With the collaboration with the animal rescue center, bird specialists, and a US 3D printing company, the group was able to create several "trial versions" to identify and finally create "the perfect one". Grecia can now skillfully use her new beak to drink water, eat, and even pick up small grains. "The design of the final product took around 2 months and the printing only took 4-5 hours." The president of SG3D Printing, Thomas Lange explained to Xinhua International during an interview that, "3D printing is not a technology of the future but has already stepped in to our lives". In January 2015, a bloodied toucan (Grecia) was found on a farm in Grecia, Alajuela Province located in central Costa Rica. The beak was brutally hacked off by a group of youngsters. She could not eat at all and was in critical condition. After the media covered the story of Grecia's tragic situation, it triggered a wave of opposition on animal cruelty in and outside of Costa Rica. People have since called out for a stricter animal protection law and for harsher penalties for animal abuse. People proactively came together to do their best to help Grecia recover and regain her life before being injured. Chuck Hall who is the inventor of 3D printing was also involved in the design of Grecia's beak. "Grecia's situation was a very special one as there was less than 1 cm of the upper jaw left, which caused many difficulties in attaching the beak." "We first scanned Grecia then designed an extended cap that was a bit longer than the remnant beak, then glued the prosthetic beak". Lange told the reporters of Xinhua International that "By doing so, we can prevent further injury for Grecia". Before installing the prosthetic beak, the staff had to keep Grecia clean everyday to prevent infections. The story of Grecia the toucan travelled the distance and touched John Hoffman who is a producer at Discovery News Channel and Paul Heredia who is a famous documentary director. They filmed bits and pieces of the installation of Grecia's new beak to make a documentary called "Toucan Nation" which was aired on Animal Planet this month. The documentary "Toucan Nation" shows how a small Toucan inspired a nation to make changes and citizens to get involved to stop animal cruelty.</div>
	<div class="translation" id="25">Gracia is a cute female toucan with the scent of the jungle about her. In the Central American country of Costa Rica, the toucan Gracia and its story are extremely well-known. The August 10 press conference finally revealed Gracia after recovering from the operation, displaying its brand new 3D-printed plastic beak. This toucan whose upper beak was broken by someone, and which was on the brink of death, has now finally received a new lease of life. <span class="highlighted">This is the day that the bird has reached 100% recovery and the day when it could be moved to a luxurious bird house and meet its human friends who have been caring for it.</span> Gracia appears to be rather shy after moving to her new home, but quickly revealed her lively side, playing in the pool of water and using her new beak to eat grapes. To remind people of the abuse it once suffered, the technicians did not color its new beak, but kept it white, the original color of the 3D printing material. The external layer of the beak is a thin keratin sheath. The beak is hollow and only reinforced by thin, criss-crossing supporting struts of bone. Although reinforced internally, the toucan's beak is still fragile, and will crack when it is harmed. The animal aid center, an ornithologist, and a 3D printing company from the United States are working together, making several "experimental beaks" for Gracia before creating the "perfect beak" that best suits the bird. Now Gracia has become proficient in using her beak to drink, eat, and even pick up fine seed grains. "The design of the final product took about two months; printing took just four to five hours." "3D printing is not for next generation. It has become part of our life." Thomas Lange, President of SG3D told the  Xinhua News Agency. On January 2015, Gracia the toucan was found, bleeding from its mouth, by a person in a farm at Gracia, Alajuela Province in central Costa Rica. At the time, its upper beak was cruelly broken by a group of youths. It could not eat and was dying. Once reported in mass media, Gracia's sad state initiated a wave of outcry against animal abuse in and outside Costa Rica. The public requested more rigorous animal protection laws to be established, and punishment for abusers to be stepped out. People came forward voluntarily, and did the best they could to help Grecia regain its life prior to the injury. Even Chuck Hull, the inventor of 3D printing technology, also contributed towards the design of Gracia's upper beak. "Gracia's condition is quite unique. Less than 1 cm of its upper beak has remained, making it difficult to install a new beak." "We first scanned Gracia and then designed and manufactured an extended prosthetic that is slightly longer than its remaining upper beak. The prosthetic is then glued to its upper beak." "This will help reduce further invasive injury on Grecia," Lange told a XInhua international news reporter. Prior to installing the prosthetics, workers cleaned the broken beak for Gracia everyday to prevent infections. Thousands of miles away, the story of Gracia the toucan has moved renowned documentary filmmaker Paula Heredia and investigative journalist John Hoffman. Toucan Nation is a documentary that recorded in detail the process of fitting a new beak for Grecia, which was broadcast on Animal Planet this month. The documentary Toucan Nation showed how a small toucan bird could change a country and encourage every citizen to participate in the movement against animal abuse.</div>

To remind people of the damage it has suffered, instead of painting its new beak, technicians have kept the original white of the 3D printing material. The beak is covered with a thin, horny sheath that is hollow inside, with only a few thin, bone-supporting poles interlaced. Despite this internal reinforcement, the toucan's beak is still fragile and will break when it is damaged. The Animal Rescue Center, ornithologists and an American 3D printing company worked together to create several "experimental beaks" for Gracia, finally creating the "perfect beak" for her. Gracia is now adept at using her new beak to drink, eat and even pick up tiny grains. "The final product took about two months to design and only four or five hours to print." "3D printing is not the technology of the future, it has really come into your life and mine," Thomas Langer, chairman of SG3D printing company, told Xinhua International. Gracia, a toucan covered in blood, was discovered on a farm in Gracia, in the central Alajuela province of Costa Rica, in January 2015. At that time, its beak was brutally broken by a group of young people, it was completely unable to eat, life-threatening. The tragedy in Gracia has caused a flurry of calls against animal cruelty in and around Costa Rica after media reports. There have been calls for stricter animal protection laws and greater penalties for abusers. People came spontaneously and did their best to help Gracia get back to life as much as possible before the injury. Even Chuck Hull, the inventor of 3D printing technology, was involved in the design of Gracia's upper beak. "The case of Gracia is unique in that the remaining part of its upper beak is less than one centimetre, which makes it difficult to install a new beak," he said. "We scanned Gracia and then designed and made an extended prosthesis that was slightly longer than the rest of her upper beak. "This will reduce further invasive damage to Gracia," Langer told Xinhua International. Before installing the prosthesis, staff had to clean up Gracia's beak every day to prevent infection. Thousands of miles away, the story of Toucan Gracia moved famous documentary filmmaker Paula Heredia and Discovery News producer John Hoffman. They chronicled the installation of Gracia's new beak and recorded a documentary, "Land of the Toucans," which was shown on Animal Planet this month. The documentary "Land of Toucans" shows how a tiny toucan can make a country change for itself, and how it can involve its citizens in the fight against animal cruelty.</div>

	<div class="translation" id="27">On August 11th, when a reporter returned a call to Huang Yilin in Mianyang, Sichuan, she said “The situation was too dire at the time and the only thought I had in my mind was to save people!”. Huang Yilin is a student from Central South University of Forestry and Technology for the class of 2015. Huang Yilin, who was studying urban and rural planning, wanted to visit Sichuan Zhongzhong to learn about the local architectural design, thus travelled together with her family. At around 10:00 on August 8, Huang Yilin’s father was resting at the hotel, while Huang Yilin and her mom went out to walk around Langzhong Ancient City. Without venturing too far, they saw a group of people yelling and screaming thus went up to see what the commotion was about. She saw that "the boy was already out of sight and the girl was desperately trying to stay above water with only half her head visible as her head bobbled up and down in the river". Huang Yilin had learned how to swim when she was young and jumped in quickly to save the child. After diving in, Huang Yilin realized that despite being 165 cm tall, her feet could not touch the bottom of the river!  Although the surface of the river seemed calm, the current was strong underneath!  But she was still determined to swim toward the girl. Huang Yilin said that the river was muddy and turbulent and she had to use almost all her strength to reach the girl who was less than 5 meters away. She tried her best to push the little girl to the edge of the river bank. "The slope was very slippery and I was afraid that I would use up my energy and sink." Huang Yilin called out to her mom for help. Her mom heard her cry for help and was about to go in the water and help. However as her mom was not in proper attire, she was stopped by a tourist beside her. <span class="highlighted">On August 10th, after Huang Yilin jumped in the river to save the child, her mom was bombarded with comments, compliments, and "questions" from friends and relatives.</span> "If you look back at it now, it was really scary! To be honest, when she could barely hold on to the riverbank and called to me for help, my heart almost shattered." Ms. Yin said that despite being dangerous, she would still support her daughter's decision if something like this happened again. She was very proud of her daughter!  Because Huang Yilin was forced to learn swimming, she never really swam after learning how to swim but "never thought it would come in handy in such a situation." According to the introduction of Huang Yilin's class leader Chen Yi-yang, Huang Yi-lin is recognized as an "honor student" and likes to help others.</div>
	<div class="translation" id="27">On August 11, when the reporter's telephone interview reached Huang Yilin who has returned to her home at Jinyang in Sichuan, she said: "It was an emergency. The only thing I could think of is to rescue people." Huang Yiling is a student of the 2015 cohort of the Landscape Architecture School in the Central South University Forestry and Technology. Huang Yilin who is now studying the professional field of town and country planning wishes to visit Langzhong in Sichuan to learn about architecture in that region, and thus took the entire family to a trip to that location. At about 10 am on August 8, Huang Yilin's father was resting at the hotel, while she and her mother were getting ready to wander about Langzhong Ancient City. After walking for a short distance, they saw a small crowd screaming and yelling, and approached them out of curiosity. Seeing that the "little boy has disappeared and that the little girl is splashing around in the water, with her head bobbing up and down the river water as the water keeps dragging her down", Huang Yilin, who had learned swimming at a young age, jumped into the water to save the child. After jumping into the river, 165-meter tall Huang Yilin realized she could not find the bottom! The water surface which seemed serene previously hid powerful currents underneath. But she did everything she could to swim toward the little girl. Huang Yilin said that the river was muddy and rapid. She was almost spent swimming a distance of less than 5 meters. She used her entire strength to push the little girl to the side of the levee. "The slope is so slipper. I thought I might sink when I run out of power." Huang Yilin therefore cried out to her mother for help. Upon hearing her daughter's cries, Mdm Yin, who was not a good swimmer, decided to go into the water but was stopped by other swimmers. <span class="highlighted">On August 10, after the story of Huang Yilin leaping into the river to save a girl spread, Mdm Yin received plenty of words of comfort and praise from family members and friends, as well as "blame" from many.</span> " I still feel the linger fear! To tell you the truth, my heart was broken when the kid almost fading on the bank cried out for help. Fear still lingered in Mdm Yin's heart. Despite the dangers, Mdm Yin said that she would still support the choice made by her daughter under such circumstances and felt proud for what she did. Huang Yilin seldom took the initiative to go swimming after she learned the skill because she was forced into it. "Who would have thought it would come in handy." According to Huang Yilin's class monitor Chen Yiyang, the class has long regarded Huang Yilin as the "top-scoring student" and knew that she is willing to help others.</div>
	<div class="translation" id="27">"It was so urgent," said Huang Yilin, who returned to her home in Mianyang, Sichuan province, in a telephone interview on August 11.

Huang Yilin, who studies urban and rural planning, wanted to visit Langzhong in Sichuan to learn about local architectural design, so the family went on a trip. On August 8, around 10 o'clock in the morning, Huang Yilin's father rested in the hotel, the mother and daughter came out to prepare to stroll the Langzhong ancient city. Just go not far away, suddenly see a group of people shouting, out of curiosity and then stepped forward. Seeing the "little boy has disappeared, the little girl in the water desperately flutter, the river only revealed her little head, from time to time to sink," a child learned to swim Huang Yilin hurriedly jumped down to save people. After entering the water, the 165cm Huang Yilin found that she could not walk to the end of the road!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Seemingly calm before the surface of the water, but underneath the torrent! But she was still desperate to swim to the little girl. Huang said the river was muddy and fast-flowing, less than five meters away and it took almost all her strength. She pushed the little girl as hard as she could to the bank of the river. "The slope was so slippery that I was afraid I wouldn't have the strength to go down." So Huang Yilin asked for help from her mother, heard her daughter's cry for help, and Ms. Yin, who was not in good water, prepared to go into the water to rescue her, and was stopped by the tourists next to her. <span class="highlighted">August 10, Huang Yilin jumped into the river to save people after the news spread, Ms. Yin received a lot of friends and family condolences, praise, but also by many friends and family "accountability."</span> "In retrospect it was really scary! To tell you the truth, my heart broke when the child could hardly hold out on the riverbank and asked for my help." Ms. Yin said with fright that even though it was dangerous, she would still support her daughter's choice if she was in a scene like that again, and she was proud of her daughter! Being forced, Huang rarely volunteered to go back into the water after learning to swim, "not expecting the skill to really come in handy." According to Huang Yilin's class monitor Chen Yilin, Huang Yilin is recognized as a "school bully" in the class, and is willing to help others.</div>

	<div class="translation" id="29">Qingdao is the 12th city in the nation and the first in Shandong Province to implement the pilot program for paying for the use and trading of emissions rights. On the 11th, many companies submitted emission rights purchase applications at the Qingdao Emissions Trading Center. Those who successfully applied for the rights will start paying a usage fee. The imminent completion of this first trade also marks the official launch of the pilot program for the trading of emission rights in Qingdao. This will also be the first emission rights trade in the Province as well as the first city-level  emission rights trade in the nation. In the morning of the 11th, Zhao Xiuping, general manager of Qingdao Shuangtao Jingxi Chemical Industry (Group) came to the Qingdao City Emissions Trading Center to submit an application to purchase emission rights. This corporation, situated in the factory area of Old Town of Qingdao, stopped its production lines at the end of last year, and was moved, using environment-friendly means, to a new plant area in Pingdu. Zhao Xiuping submitted the application form, environmental impact report, and other materials for the construction project. The Qingdao City Emissions Reserve and Trading Service Center began preliminary reviews of the application materials. According to the collection criteria determined by Qingdao's pricing, finance and other departments, the  initial usage fee for emissions rights is currently estimated at approximately RMB641,200. Staff will complete checking and ratification within seven working days. The first transaction, which will be completed soon, also marks the formal initiation of the Qingdao Emissions Trading Pilot Project. This will also be the first emissions trading in the province and the first city-level emissions trading in the entire country. Zhao Xiuping said, "Presently, enterprises have invested RMB400 million in environmental protection. On the surface, this seems an enormous amount, but it has a profound impact on both the operational and management philosophy of enterprises as well as social benefit, and has provided room for innovative management by enterprises. On that day, Qingdao Sifang Xincheng Zhizhuo Coach Components Co., Ltd. also came to apply for and purchase emission rights for the project to produce 4,200 pieces of interior accessories and components for high speed train and electric multiple units. This project is initiated by a mechanical processing company. The company is applying for an initial emissions as chemical oxygen demand (COD) of 0.514 tons/year and ammonia nitrogen (NOX) of 0.052 tons/year. Paying for the use and trading of air pollutant emissions rights is for the city's key power and heat production and supply industrial enterprises. Existing polluting companies that have received a bad rating prior to January 1, 2016 will be temporarily exempt from the usage fee. "Paying for emission rights does not mean gaining the right to generate illegal emissions. The payer may not emit waste as they like." Deputy Director Han Hongyan of the Qingdao Environmental Protection Bureau explained that illegal emissions or emissions that exceed specified limits shall be subject to penalties according to relevant laws. Violating companies will not be able to purchase emission rights to avoid punishments. <span class="highlighted">In another word, we should fight against environmental offense and  excessive discharge by enterprises with serious legal action to protect our environment and public health.</span> Enterprises are now more enthusiastic about pollution treatment because of their own interests; limited emission rights are valued, and emission of pollutants has decreased. Driven by economic interest, reducing emission of pollutants will shift from mandatory acts imposed by the government to conscious corporate market behavior. Thus, the goal of protecting the environment and nature as well as ensuring public health will be achieved. The right to discharge pollutants, or "emission rights", are a right to emit pollutants, i.e., polluters, within a quota allocated by the government, enjoy the right to discharge pollutants into the environment according to the law. This right is in essence, the right polluters have on the ownership, use and profit of existing resources in the environment. In the next step, under the pretext of keeping total emissions within the allowable emission volume, various internal sources of pollution shall use currency exchange to modulate emissions. Emissions trading was first proposed by the US economist Dales in 1968. In the 1970s, the US made use of this to manage sources of atmospheric and river pollution. Pilot programs were initiated since 2007. Currently, the program is being fully implemented at Zhejiang, Jiangsu, and other 14 provinces (in districts and cities).</div>
	<div class="translation" id="29">Qingdao is the 12th and the first pilot city in Shandong Province to utilize a carbon trading scheme. On the 11th, many companies came to the Qingdao's Emission Trading Center to submit their carbon trading application and will pay the permit fees once it is processed. The first trading done represents that the carbon emission trading pilot program has officially started, and will be the first in the province to introduce the emission trading scheme at the city-level. On the morning of the 11th, Zhao Xiuping, the president of Qingdao Shuangtao Jingxi Chemical Industry (Group) Limited Company, came to the Qingdao Emissions Trading Center to submit an application to purchase an emission permit. The same company had a plant in Qingdao's old town but was shut down last year and relocated to Pingdu for environmental concerns. After Zhao Xiuping submitted the construction and environmental assessment permit application, the Qingdao Emissions Trading Center started to do a preliminary review of the submitted application. The estimated initial emission fee is approximately 641,200 yuan according to the collection standards set by Qingdao Pricing Administration. The staff will process and verify it within 7 business days. The first trading done represents that the carbon emission trading pilot program has officially started, and will be the first in the province to introduce the emission trading scheme at the city-level. Zhao Xiuping mentioned that he has invested RMB 400 million on corporate environmental responsibility. Despite being a large amount of money put into this, it greatly impacts the company's philosophy, social responsibility, and also opens up a new level of innovation management. On the same day, Qingdao Sifang Xincheng Zhizhuo Coach Parts Co., Ltd. also came to purchase emission permits for their annual production of 4,200 pieces of high-speed rail and EMU (Electrical Multiple Unit) interior parts. This project was for the machining companies, with initial emission amount of 0.514 ton/yr of COD, and 0.052 ton/yr of NOX on their application. The carbon emission trading is an important business to support electricity and heat for the city. The carbon credits obtained from EIA before January 1, 2016 will not be charged with the usage fee for the time being. "Purchasing an emission permit does not grant permission to freely discharge illegal pollutants." Han Hongyan, the Deputy Director of the Environmental Protection Bureau of Qingdao stated the those who discharge illegal pollutants and excessive pollutants will still be punished according to the regulation; those discharging illegal discharge of pollutants and excessive discharge of pollutants will still have to be punished in accordance with relevant regulations, and companies will not be able to purchase emission permits to avoid punishment for illegal or excessive discharges. <span class="highlighted">Basically, through legal measures and being stringent on environmental violations and to punish companies for excessive discharges, we will be able to protect the environment and the health of the public.</span> Companies have now put their focus on managing emissions for their own benefit and appreciate limiting the emission amount which has lead to a reduction of pollutants being discharged. With the economic benefits being a factor, the government's bold action has lead to company's to react to take action on reducing emissions. This will all lead to protecting the environment, nature, and the health of the public. The right to emit pollutants, also known as “emissions permit”. It refers to the right of emitters to discharge pollutants to the environment within the limits allocated by the government. This type of right limits the footprint of the polluters in the environment and a right to gain revenue. The next step, assuming that the discharged pollutant does not exceed the limit is to control the emission amount  through carbon emission trading. Emissions trading was proposed by American economist John Dales back in 1968. Since the 1970s in the 20th Century, the United States has applied it to control pollution in the atmosphere and river. China has been doing trials since 2007, and has implemented it in 14 provinces (in regions and cities) including Zhejiang and Jiangsu.</div>

On the morning of November 11, Zhao Xiuping, general manager of Qingdao Shuangtao Fine Chemical Industry (Group) Co., Ltd. came to Qingdao Emission Trading Center to submit the application for emission rights. The enterprise is located in the old city of Qingdao plant at the end of last year to stop production, environmental protection moved to the new plant in Pingdu. After Zhao Xiuping submitted the application form, the environmental impact statement of the construction project and other materials, the Qingdao Municipal Emission Right Reserve and Trading Service Center began the preliminary examination of the application materials.

Zhao Xiuping said: At present, enterprises have invested 400 million in environmental protection, a huge amount on the surface, but the concept of business management, social benefits have a great impact on the enterprise innovation and management has also opened up space. On the same day, Qingdao Sifang Xinchengzhizhuo Bus Accessories Co., Ltd. has also come to the annual output of 4,200 high-speed rail and EMU interior accessories projects to purchase emission rights. The project belongs to the mechanical processing enterprises, the application for the initial emission of chemical oxygen demand (COD) 0.514 tons / year, ammonia nitrogen (NOX) 0.052 tons / year. Air pollutant emission rights paid use and trade for the city's electricity, thermal production and supply of key industrial enterprises. Existing units that have obtained an EIA prior to January 1, 2016, will not be charged a toll fee for the time being. "Paid access to emission permits is not the same as access to the power of illegal discharge of pollutants, and can not be arbitrarily discharged pollutants." Han Hongyan, deputy director of Qingdao Municipal Environmental Protection Bureau, said that if illegal discharge, excessive discharge should still be punished in accordance with the relevant regulations, it is impossible to allow illegal enterprises through the purchase of pollution rights to avoid punishment. <span class="highlighted">In other words, through legal means to crack down on environmental violations, and severely punish enterprises for excessive pollution, so as to protect the environment and protect public health.</span> Now enterprises for their own interests, improve the enthusiasm of pollution control, cherish the limited emission rights, reducing the emission of pollutants. Driven by the economic benefits, reducing the emission of pollutants will change from the government's compulsory behavior to the enterprise's conscious market behavior, so as to truly achieve the goal of protecting the environment, protecting nature and protecting public health. Emission right, also known as "emission right", is the right to discharge pollutants, which refers to the right of the emitter to discharge pollutants into the environment within the quota allocated by the government according to law. This right is essentially the right of the polluter to possess, use and benefit from the environmental capacity resources. Next, under the premise that the total amount of pollutants discharged does not exceed the permitted amount, the amount of pollutants discharged is adjusted by means of currency exchange between the internal sources of pollution. Since the emission trading was put forward by American economist Dales in 1968, it has been applied to the management of air and river pollution sources in the United States since the 1970s. China began to carry out pilot projects in 2007, and 14 provinces (autonomous regions and municipalities), including Zhejiang and Jiangsu, have been fully implemented.</div>

	<div class="translation" id="30">Media revealed that the deluge of capital that swamped online health care resulted in the severe product homogeneity problem we see today. The investment boom is waning gradually. Capital has entered a wait-and-see period. Figures from Hong Kong Ailibi Hospital Management Research Center revealed that many online health care companies close down within the first year of incorporation; approximately 20% of newly founded online health care enterprises no longer exist. However, while most Internet health care companies were struggling to choose between Series A or Series B financing, a number of leading companies in specialized sectors were still able to attract capital. It seems that "rushing headlong" into the Industry healthcare sector is not the wisest option. One must accurately assess market requirements, be patient, and improve the professionalism and depth of services provided. Yuyue contributed 12.0000 million dollars, comprising 40% of the registered capital, while Jointown Pharmaceutical provided 18.0000 million dollars for 60% of the registered capital. In recent years, thanks to national policy support in terms of medical informatization, electronic and integrated supply chain management systems have been gradually introduced into different classes of hospitals. The partnership between Yuyue and Jointown Pharmaceutical aims at meeting market demands and helping hospital establish an advanced supply chain management system. The partnership is also an opportunity to seek additional partnerships. Unlike many Internet health care companies obsessed with scale and extensive coverage, iBaby focused on the vertical industry of obstetrics from the very beginning, channeling their efforts toward supporting both pregnant mothers and their physicians. Pregnant mothers can receive 24-hours one-on-one consultation with a specialist physician for free. They can also pay for personal consultation with a specified physician. At the doctors' end, iBaby has broken down regional restrictions by way of organizing experts to carry out webinars, peer exchanges, case discussions and other mini-seminars. Currently, three segments have been set up at the doctor's end, namely, continuing education for doctors, social networking for doctors, and help for doctors. The contents provided include online learning, medical case studies, and academic exchange; social networking platform between physicians of the same hospital or same departments; and doctor-patient relationships or legal assistance necessary for personal lifestyles, entrepreneurship support, and other services. Media report that CEO Wang Lei expressed that Alibaba Health is "willing to settle down" and takeover the Big Data analytics for health. Online businesses and data companies lack professionalism, and were unable to achieve uniformity in the terminologies of identical keywords. <span class="highlighted">Alibaba has structured its presence in the health care industry into three segments, namely Alibaba Health, Tmall Pharmacy, and Alipay's Future Hospital.</span> Wang Lei disclosed that starting a medical healthcare company is more challenging when compared to other sectors. "This is not just about making money. You must be patient and get used to loneliness to do this properly."</div>
	<div class="translation" id="30">According to media reports, due to the previous large-scale influx of capital into Internet medicine, resulting in the current serious problem of product homogenization, the investment boom gradually receded, capital into a wait and see period. According to data from the Centre for Management Research at Ellison Hospital in Hong Kong, a large number of Internet medical companies have died within one year of their establishment, and about 20 per cent of the start-up Internet medical companies have ceased to exist. However, just as most internet healthcare companies struggle to finance rounds A and B, several segment leaders are still gaining traction. It seems that the Internet can not be a medical entrepreneurship "swarm", but to look at the market demand, sink down to do special, do deep. Yuyue made a capital contribution of 12 million yuan, accounting for 40 percent of the registered capital, and Kyushu Tong Instrument Company made a capital contribution of 18 million yuan, accounting for 60 percent of the registered capital. In recent years, with the state's policy support in medical information, electronic, integrated supply chain management system gradually into all levels of hospitals. The cooperation between Yuyue and Kyushu Tong is precisely aimed at the needs of the market, helping hospitals to build advanced supply chain management system, and using this as an opportunity to seek more cooperation. Unlike many internet healthcare companies, iBaby has been focused on the internet obstetrics vertical since its inception, working both as a mother and a doctor. Pregnant mothers are not only entitled to free 24-hour and one-on-one consultation with a doctor in charge, but are also entitled to paid, directed medical consultation. At the doctor's end, iBaby breaks geographical boundaries by organizing experts to give microlectures, such as online lectures, peer-to-peer exchanges, and case discussions, to doctors at the grass-roots level. At present, the doctor side opened three sections, respectively, for doctors to continue education, doctors social and doctors for help. Services include online learning, case discussions, academic exchanges, social networking platforms with hospitals and doctors in departments, legal assistance for doctor-patient relationships or personal life, and support for entrepreneurship. CEO Wang Lei recently said Ali Health was "willing to sink in" to take down health big data, according to media reports. Internet companies, data companies lack professionalism in the same entry on the writing methods are not uniform. <span class="highlighted">Ali's current layout in the field of health care is divided into three sections, namely Ali Health, Tmall Medicine Hall and Alipay Future Hospital.</span> "It's not just a matter of how much money you have," Wang admits. "It's a matter of getting down and being able to live with the loneliness and do it slowly."</div>
	<div class="translation" id="30">According to media reports, due to the large surge of capital into IOMT (internet of medical things), which resulted in a serious issue of product consistency. With the investment boom slowing down, investments have entered a wait-and-see period. According to data from the Hong Kong Alec Hospital Management Research Center, a large number of venture IOMT companies have gone out of business within a year of starting, and about 20% of them have disappeared. However, just as most of the IOMT companies struggled in the A or B round of financing, there were several leading companies in the niche areas who were still able to obtain sufficient capital. From this observation, one can say that these IOMT cannot "simply all come about doing the same thing", but to watch the market demand and do their due diligence. Jiangsu Yuyue Mdcl Eqpmnt & Spply Co Ltd. invested 120 million yuan, accounting for 40% of the registered capital, and Jiuzhou Tongji Machinery Co., Ltd. invested 180 million yuan, accounting for 60% of the registered capital. In recent years, the digitalized and integrated supply chain management system is slowly being utilized in various levels of hospitals thanks to country's support in the form of policies on the information of IOMT. The cooperation between Jiangsu Yuyue Mdcl Eqpmnt & Spply Co Ltd. and Jiuzhou Tongji Machinery Co., Ltd. targets the market demands, supports hospitals implement advanced supply chain management systems and use this as an opportunity to seek further collaboration. Unlike many IOMT companies, iBaby has been focusing on the vertical field of obstetrics for the Internet from the very beginning and has been working with both mothers and doctors. "On a 24-hour basis, pregnant mothers can not only receive free one-on-one consultations with qualified doctors, and also receive paid medical diagnosis." From the doctor's side, iBaby allows them to provide lectures, communicate better with peers, discuss cases beyond the geographic barriers. Currently, the doctors can set up three sections for doctors to continue their education, communicate with other doctors, and request help from doctors. This provides business support for online learning, case discussions, academic exchanges; social networking with hospitals and doctors in the same department, and necessary legal support relating to doctor-patient relationship. According to media reports, CEO Wang Lei recently stated that AliHealth "has decided" to compile the healthcare data. Tech companies and data companies lack professionalism and cannot cooperate. <span class="highlighted">Alibaba's current presence in the healthcare industry is divided into three sections: AliHealth, Tmall Online Pharmacy, and Alipay's "Future Hospital" program.</span> Wang Lei admitted that business in the healthcare is more difficult than other industries. “It is not simply having enough money, but to be able to persevere and work step by step."</div>

"Social networking has the characteristics of low cost, high transmission speed and multiple people communicating at the same time, which meets the needs of contemporary college students." Expanding the circle of relationships, having more equal conversations, and avoiding social concerns are the main reasons why we love online chatting more and more. Newcomers to the company love to communicate with colleagues online, "because they are not familiar with the unit, through the social platform praise comments, the relationship is much closer than before." Love to make friends is also commonly used online communication, "with friends before because of some misunderstanding did not contact for some time, and later in a large group of first dialogue a few words before they warm up again." Wu Yan, an IT engineer, is a deep social network enthusiast. Most of his social life takes place online, with online contacts several times larger than the number of offline friends. Wu Yan himself also admitted to being more "like a duck to water" on the Internet. "You can reply to a friend when it's convenient for you, because you have a lot of time to think about words and you can express them more clearly." "Hidden under the ID, you and I avoid face-to-face collisions, not only have room to maneuver, and even give each other more time and space to think about words and deeds." "People of different identities have the right and efficiency to speak the same way, and social concerns in real life seem to be dispelled in cyberspace." However, Wu Yan's friend Xiao Peng feels that Wu Yan in life is a "pretty boring house man." Xiao Peng and Wu Yan met in a large group because they were both active speakers and soon became familiar with each other. Xiao Peng feels that Wu Yan is different from the Internet, the language is boring, do not take the initiative to express their views, flipping over and over is a few words, "Oh, OK, is it", or "This I want to check on the Internet."</div>
	<div class="translation" id="31">On the surface, social networking platforms have widened the social circle and reduced loneliness. <span class="highlighted">The scope of influence of online social networking has become increasingly widespread. Not only has it gradually replaced traditional phone communication, it has even permeated actual offline living circles, quietly changing the social activities of the masses.</span> The benefit of online social networking is obvious. It is easy and convenient, and is therefore much preferred by younger demographics. A survey investigating college student socializing habits found that 57% of college students spend more than 5 hours a day on cellphones, literally making cellphones "inseparable" during everyday lives. "The characteristics of social networks include being low-cost, having fast transmission rates, and allowing many people to interact simultaneously. This suits the needs of contemporary university students. Expanded relationship circles, being able to chat on equal footing, and avoidance of social stigma are the main reasons why we become increasingly fond of online chat. The newcomers enjoy online communication with other employees, " because we are not familiar with each other at the beginning. But the 'like' and comment in the social media will close the distance." People who enjoy making friends also used online networking. "I haven't been contacting a friend for a while due to some misunderstanding. We then shared a few words in a larger group and things got better from there." IT engineer Wu Yan is strong fan for social networking, and spends most of his socializing time and life online, with many more online contacts than friends he meet offline. Wu Yan himself honestly said that he feels like "fish returned to the water" when he goes online. "You may reply to a friend when you are willing at a time that is convenient for you to do so because there is plenty of time for you to deliberate the wordings, and you can also express yourself more clearly." "The ID provides one with a cover to avoid all face-to-face interpersonal conflicts, providing one with more room to maneuver and also provided both sides with more time and space to think about what they say." "People of different status are given the same rights to speech and the same voice. Various social taboos in real life seem to disappear in the online world." Xiaopeng, a friend of Wu Yan, felt that the real life Wu Yan is a "boring geek". Xiaopeng and Wu Yan met in a big group. As they were both active speakers, they became acquainted very quickly. Xiaopeng felt that Wu Yan was completely different from his online personality. The real Wu Yan used little words and never gave any opinions. The only phrases he would use were: "Ho ho. Alright. Really?" or "I'll check that online."</div>

New company staffs likes to communicate with their coworkers online. "As many are not familiar with it, they communicated without borders which built a good relationship among them." People who like to make friends also like to use this. "There was an instance where I had lost contact with someone due to a misunderstanding. However I was able to connect with that person again by conversing in groups." Wu Yan, an IT engineer, is an in-depth social networking enthusiast. Most of his social life happens online, where the number of people online is several times more than those offline. Wu Yan admits that being online is "like being a fish in the water". "You can reply your friends at your own pace. You will be able to express yourself better as you have time to think about what to write." "You can stay behind your online ID and avoid face-to-face conflict; will have the peace of mind to think things out before taking action." "Two different people can come together and communicate at the same level. Thus the social concerns in real life seem to be non-existent online." However, Wu’s friend Xiaopeng thinks that Wu’s life is enclosed and abnormal. Xiaopeng and Wu Yan met in a large group and as they were both active talkers, they quickly became good friends. Xiaopeng felt that Wu Yan and two other people online were bland and did not actively express their opinions. Their replies were often "Oh, ok, really," or "Let me check online."</div>

	<div class="translation" id="36">Unfortunately, the latest OPEC monthly report shows that crude oil production continued to increase in July, and Saudi Arabia's production hit a new high. This report doesn't prevent the market from doubting OPEC. The road to recovery for oil price seems to be a tough one. On Monday, Sada who is OPEC's president and Qatar's Energy Minister said that OPEC will hold an informal meeting during the International Energy Forum on September 26-28. The monthly report released by OPEC on Wednesday showed that all OPEC members including Gabon increased their July production by an additional 46,000 barrels per day to 33.11 million barrels per day. OPEC also said in its monthly report that low crude oil prices have prompted the world's refiners to produce more refined oil products, which has increased the level of excess supply in the market. The international oil price fell for two consecutive days with this news and as the US raised their forecast on crude oil production along with the unexpected increase in crude oil inventory. As of Wednesday's close, the New York Mercantile Exchange's September delivery of light crude oil futures fell 2.48%, and the October delivery of London Brent crude oil futures fell 2.07%. Reuters believes that the proposed meeting of oil-producing countries is unlikely to significantly tighten supply, and data released by the US Energy Information Administration also weighed on market sentiment. Iran’s official news agency Fars quoted Iran’s oil minister Zaganga’s statement on Wednesday, saying that Iran’s maximum daily crude oil output was 3.85 million barrels, which is the highest level since 2008. The result of the meeting was just announced and the Russian Energy Minister Novak stated that there is no need for a new round of negotiations on production freeze with the current oil price. The meeting with the oil-producing country was back in April. OPEC member states were not able to reach an agreement whatsoever.  Emma Richards, an oil and gas analyst at BMI Research, said that the market and the media may be a bit too sensitive to the OPEC meeting. Helima Croft, head of commodities strategy at Royal Bank of Canada, said that OPEC changed market sentiment by releasing signals that they would facilitate the deal. This is like the smoke and mirror method of drawing away attention (and giving the wrong impression). <span class="highlighted">Eugen Weinberg, Head of Commodity Research at Commerzbank AG, said that people think that OPEC is unlikely to try to stabilize the market through the September meeting.</span> This is likely to further undermine the market's confidence in OPEC, after all, the organization has already pulled "the boy who cried wolf."</div>
	<div class="translation" id="36">Unfortunately, the latest monthly report of OPEC indicated continuous increase in crude oil production volume in July. Saudi Arabia even reached in a record height in terms of production volume. This report couldn't help but trigger market suspicion over OPEC's credibility. The path toward recovery in oil prices is still difficult. On Monday, Qatar's Energy Minister Mohammed Bin Saleh Al-Sada who holds OPEC's rotating presidency said that OPEC will hold an unofficial meeting during the International Energy Foundation conference which will be held between September 26 and 28. OPEC's monthly report published on Wednesday showed that OPEC's total output (including Gabon) in July rose by 46,000 barrels/day to 33.11 million barrels/day. OPEC expressed in its monthly report that the low price of crude oil has encouraged more refineries around the world to produce more refined oil products, worsening the issue of excessive supply in the market. This news, coupled with the US raising its crude oil production forecast and unexpected increase in crude oil stockpiles has caused global oil prices to fall for two consecutive days. The price of light crude oil futures for delivery in September closed 2.48% lower on the New York Mercantile Exchange as of Wednesday, while the price of Brent crude oil futures for delivery in October fell 2.07%. Reuters believe that the proposed conference of the petroleum producing countries is unlikely to order significant reduction in production. Data published by the US Energy Information Administration also cooled the market. Fars, the official media company of Iran, quoted Iranian Minister of Petroleum Zanganeh who said that the maximum crude oil production of Iran will be 3.85 million barrels per day, the highest volume since 2008. Once information for the meeting has been released, Novak, the Russian Minister of Energy, expressed that under current oil prices, there is no need to initiate a new round of negotiations regarding frozen assets. The last time oil producing naitons convened a meeting was in April. OPEC members failed to reach an agreement on any measure. BMI Research Oil and Gas Analyst Emma Richards said that the market and the media may have over-reacted to the meeting OPEC is about to convene. Helima Croft, Top Commodities Strategist of Royal Bank of Canada, expressed that OPEC has released signals that they would be reaching an agreement to transform the mood of the market. This method was like smoke and mirrors to divert people's attention (deliberately giving people the wrong impression). <span class="highlighted">Eugen Weinberg, Head of Commodity Research at Commerzbank AG, said that people believe that there is a low possibility for OPEC to use the September meeting to stabilize the market.</span> This might further disrupt market confidence for OPEC as this organization has "cried wolf" before.</div>

Helima Croft, head of commodities strategy at Royal Bank of Canada, said OPEC had changed sentiment by sending signals that they would facilitate a deal. This technique is like smoke and mirrors (deliberately giving the wrong impression) to distract people from their vision. <span class="highlighted">According to Eugen Weinberg, head of commodities research at Commerzbank, the chances of OPEC trying to stabilise the market through the September meeting are thought to be low.</span> This is likely to further undermine confidence in OPEC, after all, the group staged a "wolf."</div>

Apple didn't respond, but word has spread about the new iPhone's features and configuration, and even pictures of the iPhone 7's "real model" are available online. The next generation of iPhones is "eye-catching", hot, hot, rich and out of stock... If you want to buy the real thing for the first time, make sure you choose a good channel, say, Suning. This added to the frustration over the new phone, "It lengthens, but it doesn't project a hologram at all! This generation of iPhones sucks." The iPhone 7, like other iPhones, has been accompanied by countless secrets before it was born. Also, multiple sources have claimed that the new iPhone will eliminate the 3.5mm headphone jack and instead use a Bluetooth connection and charging jack, which would give Apple room to add a second speaker. Another piece of evidence to back up the news is that back in 2014 Apple allowed headphone makers to make headphone products that were connected through a charging interface. The news is either true or false, and the answer won't be revealed until Apple's autumn 2016 launch. <span class="highlighted">But that doesn't detract from the industry's bullish outlook for the iPhone 7 - which many believe will most likely be Apple's last major upgrade to the iPhone family.</span> Though the iPhone's market share has fallen, according to data released recently by market research firm IDC. Among them, Goldman Sachs maintained a "buy" rating on Apple's stock, while BMO analysts said the iPhone 7 would reap a historic sales performance. At the same time, Hock Tan, CEO of Broadcom, said it was likely that Apple would increase revenue by more than 20 percent in the future, thanks entirely to the launch of the iPhone 7. Seven percent of respondents said they planned to buy the iPhone 7, compared with just four percent two years ago. It is understood that 20 per cent of the current group of users who hold the iPhone 6 or 6Plus plan to buy the iPhone 7, which is a fairly high percentage. Second, there is expert analysis, most of the fruit powder like to replace their iPhone handsets from generation to generation. About 26 percent of all iPhone users have not changed their phone in two years, or nearly 120 million users have had their iPhone for two years, according to the report. Media captionTaiwan has been hit by several earthquakes during the production of the iPhone 7. "TSMC's production facilities have been damaged beyond imagination and could have an impact on the initial supply of the iPhone 7." Contradictions between supply and demand will affect ordinary users, it is time to choose a good channel, the first time low prices to start the genuine iPhone 7. According to people familiar with the matter, recently, Suning executives have been meeting with Apple frequently in order to prepare an adequate supply. The operator has already negotiated with Suning, and predictably, with the deep cooperation between the two sides, it is bound to bring lower prices and more intimate services to users. "At the lowest price, consumers might be able to buy an iPhone 7 for as little as $7 a day," he said. Sufficient supply and a variety of concessions, so that the purchase of the iPhone 7 is no longer "pressure mountain," and Suning's logistics, is to turn this beautiful into a more intuitive experience.

Although Apple did not respond, news concerning the functions and configuration of the iPhone are being released gradually. Pictures of the "actual phone model" have even appeared on the Internet. The new iPhone could be considered a "public phenomenon". It's popular, sleek, and could not be acquired even if you have the money to pay for it. If you want to buy an original product, you must opt for a proper sales channel such as Suning. This heightened the people's sense of disappointment for the new cellphone. "It became longer, but couldn't project holographs! This iPhone release sucks." Like other iPhones, numerous anecdotes and secret information accompanied the iPhone 7 before its debut. Elsewhere, many sources of information also claimed that the 3.5mm headphone jack will be removed from the new iPhone to be replaced by bluetooth connection and the charging interface. This will give Apple room for adding a second speaker. Another piece of corroborative evidence is that as far back as 2014, Apple had already allowed headphone manufacturers to connect headphone products through the charging interface. The answer to such news, whether true or false, will only be revealed by Apple at the 2016 Fall launch event. <span class="highlighted">This did not stop industry insiders from taking a positive view of the prospects of iPhone 7 however. Many believed that iPhone 7 could very well be the last time Apple would significantly upgrade the iPhone series.</span> However, data recently published by IDC, a market intelligence firm, showed the market share of iPhone has decreased slightly. Goldman Sachs has rated Apple shares as something that can be "bought". BMO analysts believe that iPhone7 will establish a historical record in sales performance. Broadcom CEO Hock Tan also expressed that Apple is expected to achieve more than 20% growth in revenue. This figure can be completely attributed to the release of iPhone7. 7% of those interviewed said they intend to buy iPhone 7 compared to a mere 4% who planned to buy iPhone 6 two years ago. From information available, 20% of users currently holding an iPhone6 or 6Plus have plans for purchasing iPhone7. This proportion is quite substantial. Next, experts analyzed that most Apple fans like to replace their iPhone every other generation. Statistics revealed that among iPhone users, approximately 26% of users have not changed their mobile phones in two years, i.e., the iPhones of about 120 million users have been used for two years. Some media reported that Taiwan has been hit by several earthquakes during the iPhone7 production period. "Damages sustained by TSMC production facilities may have went beyond expectations, and that could have influenced initial supply for iPhone7." Supply and demand conflicts will influence normal users. It is time to select a proper channel and acquire an authentic iPhone7 early at a low price. Insider disclosure revealed that the upper management of Suning and Apple has met frequently in recent times for the purpose of preparing enough resources. Service operators have reached an agreement with Suning. It can be expected that with growing partnership between the two, users will be provided with lower prices and more dedicated services. " The lowest price. The customers might' only RMB 7 a day to get a iPhone7". Sufficient supply of goods and a variety of discounts, buyers of iPhone 7 will not be so stressed out, and Suning's logistics department will all the more turn this happiness into a more intuitive experience. Perhaps you will receive a phone call at midnight. "Hello, this is Suning.com. Your iPhone 7 has arrived."</div>
	<div class="translation" id="40">It has not yet been confirmed yet, but many sources have indicated that Apple's 2016 fall conference will be held in September. The iPhone 7 is really going to come out. Although Apple did not comment, information and specification of the new iPhone has been released and there are "actual" photos of the iPhone 7 on the web. The new generation of the iPhone is going to be slick, popular, and limited, thus if you want to be one of the first one to get a hold of it, be sure to know where to buy it from...like Suning. "This has led to further disappointment in the new phone. It is longer but can't even take videos. This generation of iPhone is terrible." Like the other iPhones, iPhone 7 had its share of secrets before being released. In addition, there are multiple sources claiming that the new generation of iPhone will not feature a 3.5mm headphone jack and use Bluetooth connectivity instead and will just have the charging port. This will provide space for Apple to add a second speaker. As evidence to backup this claim, Apple had developed earphones that would connect to the charging port back in 2014. Regardless of whether the rumors are true or not, we will only know for sure when it is announced in Apple's fall 2016 conference. <span class="highlighted">However, this does not prevent the industry from looking at the potential specification of the iPhone 7 - many believe that the iPhone 7 will most likely be Apple's last major upgrade to the iPhone series.</span> IDC, which is a market research institute recently released data that the market share of iPhone has declined. However, Goldman Sachs will maintain the "buy" rating for Apple's stock, and BMO analysts believe that iPhone7 will come together with a historic sales performance. Additionally, Broadcom’s CEO Hock Tan also stated that Apple’s future revenue growth may exceed 20%, all thanks to the launch of the iPhone 7. Seven percent of respondents said they had plans to purchase the iPhone 7, compared to only four percent who planned to purchase the iPhone 6 two years ago. It is understood that 20% of those currently using the iPhone 6 or 6 Plus plan to purchase the iPhone 7, which is a very high percentage. Also, experts analyzed that most of Apple consumers like to replace their iPhones every generation. According to the data, about 26% of all iPhone users have not changed their phones for 2 years. Which means almost 120 million people have used the iPhone for 2 years. Some media claimed that Taiwan faced several earthquakes during the production of iPhone 7 and, “The damage of TSMC's production facilities was bigger than expected and may affect the initial iPhone 7 supply.” The disparity between supply and demand will affect the average customers. It is time to choose a good place to buy an authentic iPhone 7 early at a lower price. According to informed sources, Suning executives met frequently with Apple in order to prepare enough stock. The company is already in discussion with Suning, and will inevitable provide a lower price and better service for consumers through a high-level of cooperation between the two parties. “At the lowest price, consumers may only need to pay 7 yuan a day to purchase the iPhone 7.” Plentiful stock and various services will make purchasing the iPhone less stressful. Through Suning's logistics, will further lead to a heightened buying experience. You may perhaps get a call in the middle of a night which will say "Hi this is Suning.com.

	<div class="source" id="41">尽管还没有被证实，但诸多消息源都表示，苹果2016年秋季发布会将在9月举行，iPhone7真要来了。 虽然苹果公司并未回应，但有关新iPhone的功能、配置已经陆续有消息放出，甚至网上连iPhone7“真机模型”图片都有了。 新一代iPhone可谓“万众瞩目”，火热、紧俏、有钱无货……如果你想第一时间购买到正品，一定要选择一个好渠道，比如说，苏宁。 这加剧了人们对于新手机的失望，“它加长了，却根本不能投射全息图像!这一代iPhone糟透了。” iPhone7像其他iPhone一样，出生之前就伴随着无数秘闻。 另外，还有多个消息源声称，新一代iPhone将取消3.5mm耳机接口，转而使用蓝牙连接和充电接口，这将为苹果增加第二个扬声器提供空间。 能佐证这一消息的另一证据是，早在2014年苹果就允许耳机厂商生产通过充电接口连接的耳机产品。 这些消息或真或假，答案直到苹果2016秋季发布会才能揭晓。 但这并不妨碍业内人士看好iPhone7的前景——许多人认为，iPhone7将很有可能成为苹果对iPhone系列的最后一次大幅升级。 虽然从不久前市场研究机构IDC公布的数据来看，iPhone的市场份额有所下滑。 其中，高盛将苹果的股票维持“买入”评级，而BMO的分析师则认为iPhone7将收获一份历史性的销售成绩。 同时博通公司的CEO Hock Tan也表示，苹果未来的营收增加将有可能超过20%，而这完全得益于iPhone7的推出。 <span class="highlighted">有7%的受访者表示他们有购买iPhone7的打算，而两年前计划购买iPhone6的人数比例只有4%。</span> 据了解，目前持有iPhone6或6Plus的用户群体有20%计划购买iPhone7，这是一个相当高的比例。 其次，有专家分析，大部分果粉都喜欢隔代更换自己的iPhone手机。 据统计，在所有的iPhone用户中，有大约26%的用户已经2年没有更换手机了，也就是差不多有1.2亿的用户的iPhone已经用了2年。 有媒体称，iPhone7生产期间，台湾遭遇数次地震，“台积电生产设施的受破坏程度超出想象，并有可能对初期的iPhone7供应产生影响。” 供需矛盾会影响普通用户，是时候选择一个好渠道，第一时间低价入手正品iPhone7。 据知情人士透露，近期，苏宁高层与苹果公司频频见面，目的就是为了准备充足的货源。 运营商已经与苏宁谈妥，可以预见的是，随着双方的深度合作，必然会为用户带来更低的价格和更贴心的服务。 “最低的价格，消费者可能‘一天只需7元钱，就能购买iPhone7’。” 充足的货源与多样的优惠，让购买iPhone7不再“压力山大”，而苏宁的物流，更是会把这种美好变成更直观的体验感。 也许，你半夜就会接到电话，“您好，苏宁易购，您的iPhone7到了。”</div>
	<div class="translation" id="41">Although it has yet to be proven, many information sources indicate that Apple will hold its 2016 Fall event in September. iPhone 7 is really on its way. Although Apple did not respond, news concerning the functions and configuration of the iPhone are being released gradually. Pictures of the "actual phone model" have even appeared on the Internet. The new iPhone could be considered a "public phenomenon". It's popular, sleek, and could not be acquired even if you have the money to pay for it. If you want to buy an original product, you must opt for a proper sales channel such as Suning. This heightened the people's sense of disappointment for the new cellphone. "It became longer, but couldn't project holographs! This iPhone release sucks." Like other iPhones, numerous anecdotes and secret information accompanied the iPhone 7 before its debut. Elsewhere, many sources of information also claimed that the 3.5mm headphone jack will be removed from the new iPhone to be replaced by bluetooth connection and the charging interface. This will give Apple room for adding a second speaker. Another piece of corroborative evidence is that as far back as 2014, Apple had already allowed headphone manufacturers to connect headphone products through the charging interface. The answer to such news, whether true or false, will only be revealed by Apple at the 2016 Fall launch event. This did not stop industry insiders from taking a positive view of the prospects of iPhone 7 however. Many believed that iPhone 7 could very well be the last time Apple would significantly upgrade the iPhone series. However, data recently published by IDC, a market intelligence firm, showed the market share of iPhone has decreased slightly. Goldman Sachs has rated Apple shares as something that can be "bought". BMO analysts believe that iPhone7 will establish a historical record in sales performance. Broadcom CEO Hock Tan also expressed that Apple is expected to achieve more than 20% growth in revenue. This figure can be completely attributed to the release of iPhone7. <span class="highlighted">7% of those interviewed said they intend to buy iPhone 7 compared to a mere 4% who planned to buy iPhone 6 two years ago.</span> From information available, 20% of users currently holding an iPhone6 or 6Plus have plans for purchasing iPhone7. This proportion is quite substantial. Next, experts analyzed that most Apple fans like to replace their iPhone every other generation. Statistics revealed that among iPhone users, approximately 26% of users have not changed their mobile phones in two years, i.e., the iPhones of about 120 million users have been used for two years. Some media reported that Taiwan has been hit by several earthquakes during the iPhone7 production period. "Damages sustained by TSMC production facilities may have went beyond expectations, and that could have influenced initial supply for iPhone7." Supply and demand conflicts will influence normal users. It is time to select a proper channel and acquire an authentic iPhone7 early at a low price. Insider disclosure revealed that the upper management of Suning and Apple has met frequently in recent times for the purpose of preparing enough resources. Service operators have reached an agreement with Suning. It can be expected that with growing partnership between the two, users will be provided with lower prices and more dedicated services. " The lowest price. The customers might' only RMB 7 a day to get a iPhone7". Sufficient supply of goods and a variety of discounts, buyers of iPhone 7 will not be so stressed out, and Suning's logistics department will all the more turn this happiness into a more intuitive experience. Perhaps you will receive a phone call at midnight. "Hello, this is Suning.com. Your iPhone 7 has arrived."</div>
	<div class="translation" id="41">Although it hasn't been confirmed, numerous sources have said Apple's fall 2016 launch will take place in September, and the iPhone 7 is really coming. Apple didn't respond, but word has spread about the new iPhone's features and configuration, and even pictures of the iPhone 7's "real model" are available online. The next generation of iPhones is "eye-catching", hot, hot, rich and out of stock... If you want to buy the real thing for the first time, make sure you choose a good channel, say, Suning. This added to the frustration over the new phone, "It lengthens, but it doesn't project a hologram at all! This generation of iPhones sucks." The iPhone 7, like other iPhones, has been accompanied by countless secrets before it was born. Also, multiple sources have claimed that the new iPhone will eliminate the 3.5mm headphone jack and instead use a Bluetooth connection and charging jack, which would give Apple room to add a second speaker. Another piece of evidence to back up the news is that back in 2014 Apple allowed headphone makers to make headphone products that were connected through a charging interface. The news is either true or false, and the answer won't be revealed until Apple's autumn 2016 launch. But that doesn't detract from the industry's bullish outlook for the iPhone 7 - which many believe will most likely be Apple's last major upgrade to the iPhone family. Though the iPhone's market share has fallen, according to data released recently by market research firm IDC. Among them, Goldman Sachs maintained a "buy" rating on Apple's stock, while BMO analysts said the iPhone 7 would reap a historic sales performance. At the same time, Hock Tan, CEO of Broadcom, said it was likely that Apple would increase revenue by more than 20 percent in the future, thanks entirely to the launch of the iPhone 7. <span class="highlighted">Seven percent of respondents said they planned to buy the iPhone 7, compared with just four percent two years ago.</span> It is understood that 20 per cent of the current group of users who hold the iPhone 6 or 6Plus plan to buy the iPhone 7, which is a fairly high percentage. Second, there is expert analysis, most of the fruit powder like to replace their iPhone handsets from generation to generation. About 26 percent of all iPhone users have not changed their phone in two years, or nearly 120 million users have had their iPhone for two years, according to the report. Media captionTaiwan has been hit by several earthquakes during the production of the iPhone 7. "TSMC's production facilities have been damaged beyond imagination and could have an impact on the initial supply of the iPhone 7." Contradictions between supply and demand will affect ordinary users, it is time to choose a good channel, the first time low prices to start the genuine iPhone 7. According to people familiar with the matter, recently, Suning executives have been meeting with Apple frequently in order to prepare an adequate supply. The operator has already negotiated with Suning, and predictably, with the deep cooperation between the two sides, it is bound to bring lower prices and more intimate services to users. "At the lowest price, consumers might be able to buy an iPhone 7 for as little as $7 a day," he said. Sufficient supply and a variety of concessions, so that the purchase of the iPhone 7 is no longer "pressure mountain," and Suning's logistics, is to turn this beautiful into a more intuitive experience. Maybe you'll get a call in the middle of the night saying, "Hello, Suning EasyJet, your iPhone 7 is here."</div>
	<div class="translation" id="41">It has not yet been confirmed yet, but many sources have indicated that Apple's 2016 fall conference will be held in September. The iPhone 7 is really going to come out. Although Apple did not comment, information and specification of the new iPhone has been released and there are "actual" photos of the iPhone 7 on the web. The new generation of the iPhone is going to be slick, popular, and limited, thus if you want to be one of the first one to get a hold of it, be sure to know where to buy it from...like Suning. "This has led to further disappointment in the new phone. It is longer but can't even take videos. This generation of iPhone is terrible." Like the other iPhones, iPhone 7 had its share of secrets before being released. In addition, there are multiple sources claiming that the new generation of iPhone will not feature a 3.5mm headphone jack and use Bluetooth connectivity instead and will just have the charging port. This will provide space for Apple to add a second speaker. As evidence to backup this claim, Apple had developed earphones that would connect to the charging port back in 2014. Regardless of whether the rumors are true or not, we will only know for sure when it is announced in Apple's fall 2016 conference. However, this does not prevent the industry from looking at the potential specification of the iPhone 7 - many believe that the iPhone 7 will most likely be Apple's last major upgrade to the iPhone series. IDC, which is a market research institute recently released data that the market share of iPhone has declined. However, Goldman Sachs will maintain the "buy" rating for Apple's stock, and BMO analysts believe that iPhone7 will come together with a historic sales performance. Additionally, Broadcom’s CEO Hock Tan also stated that Apple’s future revenue growth may exceed 20%, all thanks to the launch of the iPhone 7. <span class="highlighted">Seven percent of respondents said they had plans to purchase the iPhone 7, compared to only four percent who planned to purchase the iPhone 6 two years ago.</span> It is understood that 20% of those currently using the iPhone 6 or 6 Plus plan to purchase the iPhone 7, which is a very high percentage. Also, experts analyzed that most of Apple consumers like to replace their iPhones every generation. According to the data, about 26% of all iPhone users have not changed their phones for 2 years. Which means almost 120 million people have used the iPhone for 2 years. Some media claimed that Taiwan faced several earthquakes during the production of iPhone 7 and, “The damage of TSMC's production facilities was bigger than expected and may affect the initial iPhone 7 supply.” The disparity between supply and demand will affect the average customers. It is time to choose a good place to buy an authentic iPhone 7 early at a lower price. According to informed sources, Suning executives met frequently with Apple in order to prepare enough stock. The company is already in discussion with Suning, and will inevitable provide a lower price and better service for consumers through a high-level of cooperation between the two parties. “At the lowest price, consumers may only need to pay 7 yuan a day to purchase the iPhone 7.” Plentiful stock and various services will make purchasing the iPhone less stressful. Through Suning's logistics, will further lead to a heightened buying experience. You may perhaps get a call in the middle of a night which will say "Hi this is Suning.com. Your iPhone 7 is here."</div>

	<div class="source" id="44">格雷西亚是一只萌萌的雌性巨嘴鸟，浑身散发着热带雨林的气息。 在中美洲国家哥斯达黎加，巨嘴鸟格雷西亚和它的故事早已家喻户晓。 8月10日的新闻发布会上，术后康复的格雷西亚终于亮相，向人们展示它崭新的3D打印塑料鸟喙。 这只一年半前被人折断上喙、奄奄一息的巨嘴鸟，如今终于重获新生。 这一天不仅宣告着它已100%恢复健康，更是它搬进豪华鸟舍、与关心它的人类朋友们见面的日子。 初进新家的格雷西亚稍显腼腆，但不多时就变得活泼起来，在水盆里打滚嬉闹，用新喙吃葡萄。 为了提醒人们它曾经遭受的伤害，技术人员没有给它的新喙上色，而是保留了3D打印材料原有的白色。 鸟喙外是一层薄薄的角质鞘，里面中空，只有一些细细的骨质支撑杆交错排列。 虽然有这种内部加固成份，巨嘴鸟的喙还是脆弱，受到伤害时会破碎。 动物救助中心、鸟类学家和一家美国3D打印公司通力合作，为格雷西亚制作了好几个“试验喙”，终于造出最适合它的“完美喙”。 如今格雷西亚已能熟练使用新喙喝水、吃东西，甚至啄起细小谷粒。 <span class="highlighted">“最终成品的设计花了大约2个月，打印出来只需4、5个小时。”</span> “3D打印并不是未来技术，它已经实实在在走进了你我的生活。”美国SG3D打印公司董事长托马斯·朗格在接受新华国际记者采访时说。 2015年1月，在哥斯达黎加中部阿拉胡埃拉省格雷西亚的一个农场，浑身是血的巨嘴鸟格雷西亚被人发现。 当时它的上喙被一伙年轻人残忍折断，它完全无法进食，生命垂危。 格雷西亚的惨状经媒体报道后，在哥斯达黎加内外引起如潮的反对虐待动物呼声。 人们要求设立更为严格的动物保护法、加大对虐待者的惩罚力度。 人们自发前来，尽最大努力帮助格雷西亚尽可能恢复受伤前的生活。 甚至3D打印技术发明人查克·赫尔也参与到格雷西亚上喙的设计中来。 “格雷西亚的情况很特殊，它的上喙剩余部分不足1厘米，所以给安装新喙带来许多困难。” “我们先对格雷西亚扫描，然后设计、制作出一个稍长于它上喙剩余部分的延长假体，用粘胶固定在它的上喙上。” “这样可以减少对格雷西亚造成进一步侵入性伤害。”朗格对新华国际记者说。 在安装假体之前，工作人员每天都要为格雷西亚清理断喙，以防感染。 远在千里之外，巨嘴鸟格雷西亚的故事感动了著名纪录片导演葆拉·埃雷迪亚和探索新闻频道制片人约翰·霍夫曼。 他们记录下格雷西亚安装新喙过程中的点点滴滴，录制了一部纪录片《巨嘴鸟之国》，已于本月在动物星球频道上播放。 纪录片《巨嘴鸟之国》向人们展示，一只小小的巨嘴鸟是如何让一个国家为之改变、如何让国民都参与到反对虐待动物当中来。</div>
	<div class="translation" id="44">Grecia is an adorable female toucan that exudes a tropical feel. The story of Grecia the toucan has been known early on in the Central American country of Costa Rica. In the press release on August 30th, Grecia who recovered from the surgery showed off her new prosthetic 3D printed beak to the public. The toucan whose beak was hacked off by humans and was dying a year and half ago is now reborn. This day not only confirms that she is 100% healthy, but also is a day when she will be relocated to a luxurious cage and a day for those who care about her to be able to see her. Grecia was a bit shy after moving to her new home but became more lively as she played in the water and ate grapes with her new beak. The engineering specialist did not newly paint the 3D printed beak to serve as a reminder to people of what she went through, thus leaving it in the original white color of the 3D printing material. The outer layer of the beak features a thin wall of keratin, and the inside is generally hollow and is only supported by several thin bone struts. Despite the interior being reinforced, the toucan's beak is still frail and can break when damaged. With the collaboration with the animal rescue center, bird specialists, and a US 3D printing company, the group was able to create several "trial versions" to identify and finally create "the perfect one". Grecia can now skillfully use her new beak to drink water, eat, and even pick up small grains. <span class="highlighted">"The design of the final product took around 2 months and the printing only took 4-5 hours."</span> The president of SG3D Printing, Thomas Lange explained to Xinhua International during an interview that, "3D printing is not a technology of the future but has already stepped in to our lives". In January 2015, a bloodied toucan (Grecia) was found on a farm in Grecia, Alajuela Province located in central Costa Rica. The beak was brutally hacked off by a group of youngsters. She could not eat at all and was in critical condition. After the media covered the story of Grecia's tragic situation, it triggered a wave of opposition on animal cruelty in and outside of Costa Rica. People have since called out for a stricter animal protection law and for harsher penalties for animal abuse. People proactively came together to do their best to help Grecia recover and regain her life before being injured. Chuck Hall who is the inventor of 3D printing was also involved in the design of Grecia's beak. "Grecia's situation was a very special one as there was less than 1 cm of the upper jaw left, which caused many difficulties in attaching the beak." "We first scanned Grecia then designed an extended cap that was a bit longer than the remnant beak, then glued the prosthetic beak". Lange told the reporters of Xinhua International that "By doing so, we can prevent further injury for Grecia". Before installing the prosthetic beak, the staff had to keep Grecia clean everyday to prevent infections. The story of Grecia the toucan travelled the distance and touched John Hoffman who is a producer at Discovery News Channel and Paul Heredia who is a famous documentary director. They filmed bits and pieces of the installation of Grecia's new beak to make a documentary called "Toucan Nation" which was aired on Animal Planet this month. The documentary "Toucan Nation" shows how a small Toucan inspired a nation to make changes and citizens to get involved to stop animal cruelty.</div>
	<div class="translation" id="44">Gracia is a cute female toucan with the scent of the jungle about her. In the Central American country of Costa Rica, the toucan Gracia and its story are extremely well-known. The August 10 press conference finally revealed Gracia after recovering from the operation, displaying its brand new 3D-printed plastic beak. This toucan whose upper beak was broken by someone, and which was on the brink of death, has now finally received a new lease of life. This is the day that the bird has reached 100% recovery and the day when it could be moved to a luxurious bird house and meet its human friends who have been caring for it. Gracia appears to be rather shy after moving to her new home, but quickly revealed her lively side, playing in the pool of water and using her new beak to eat grapes. To remind people of the abuse it once suffered, the technicians did not color its new beak, but kept it white, the original color of the 3D printing material. The external layer of the beak is a thin keratin sheath. The beak is hollow and only reinforced by thin, criss-crossing supporting struts of bone. Although reinforced internally, the toucan's beak is still fragile, and will crack when it is harmed. The animal aid center, an ornithologist, and a 3D printing company from the United States are working together, making several "experimental beaks" for Gracia before creating the "perfect beak" that best suits the bird. Now Gracia has become proficient in using her beak to drink, eat, and even pick up fine seed grains. <span class="highlighted">"The design of the final product took about two months; printing took just four to five hours."</span> "3D printing is not for next generation. It has become part of our life." Thomas Lange, President of SG3D told the  Xinhua News Agency. On January 2015, Gracia the toucan was found, bleeding from its mouth, by a person in a farm at Gracia, Alajuela Province in central Costa Rica. At the time, its upper beak was cruelly broken by a group of youths. It could not eat and was dying. Once reported in mass media, Gracia's sad state initiated a wave of outcry against animal abuse in and outside Costa Rica. The public requested more rigorous animal protection laws to be established, and punishment for abusers to be stepped out. People came forward voluntarily, and did the best they could to help Grecia regain its life prior to the injury. Even Chuck Hull, the inventor of 3D printing technology, also contributed towards the design of Gracia's upper beak. "Gracia's condition is quite unique. Less than 1 cm of its upper beak has remained, making it difficult to install a new beak." "We first scanned Gracia and then designed and manufactured an extended prosthetic that is slightly longer than its remaining upper beak. The prosthetic is then glued to its upper beak." "This will help reduce further invasive injury on Grecia," Lange told a XInhua international news reporter. Prior to installing the prosthetics, workers cleaned the broken beak for Gracia everyday to prevent infections. Thousands of miles away, the story of Gracia the toucan has moved renowned documentary filmmaker Paula Heredia and investigative journalist John Hoffman. Toucan Nation is a documentary that recorded in detail the process of fitting a new beak for Grecia, which was broadcast on Animal Planet this month. The documentary Toucan Nation showed how a small toucan bird could change a country and encourage every citizen to participate in the movement against animal abuse.</div>

In the Central American country of Costa Rica, the toucan Gracia and its story have long been a household name. At a press conference on August 10, Gracia, who is recovering from surgery, finally appeared to show off her brand-new, 3D printed plastic beak. The dying toucan, which had its beak snapped off a year and a half ago, has been given a new lease of life. This day heralds not only its 100 per cent return to health, but also its move into the luxurious aviary and its meeting with human friends who care about it. Gracia, who had just entered her new home, was a little shy, but soon became active, wallowing in the basin and eating the grapes with her new beak. To remind people of the damage it has suffered, instead of painting its new beak, technicians have kept the original white of the 3D printing material. The beak is covered with a thin, horny sheath that is hollow inside, with only a few thin, bone-supporting poles interlaced. Despite this internal reinforcement, the toucan's beak is still fragile and will break when it is damaged. The Animal Rescue Center, ornithologists and an American 3D printing company worked together to create several "experimental beaks" for Gracia, finally creating the "perfect beak" for her. Gracia is now adept at using her new beak to drink, eat and even pick up tiny grains. <span class="highlighted">"The final product took about two months to design and only four or five hours to print."</span> "3D printing is not the technology of the future, it has really come into your life and mine," Thomas Langer, chairman of SG3D printing company, told Xinhua International. Gracia, a toucan covered in blood, was discovered on a farm in Gracia, in the central Alajuela province of Costa Rica, in January 2015. At that time, its beak was brutally broken by a group of young people, it was completely unable to eat, life-threatening. The tragedy in Gracia has caused a flurry of calls against animal cruelty in and around Costa Rica after media reports. There have been calls for stricter animal protection laws and greater penalties for abusers. People came spontaneously and did their best to help Gracia get back to life as much as possible before the injury. Even Chuck Hull, the inventor of 3D printing technology, was involved in the design of Gracia's upper beak. "The case of Gracia is unique in that the remaining part of its upper beak is less than one centimetre, which makes it difficult to install a new beak," he said. "We scanned Gracia and then designed and made an extended prosthesis that was slightly longer than the rest of her upper beak. "This will reduce further invasive damage to Gracia," Langer told Xinhua International. Before installing the prosthesis, staff had to clean up Gracia's beak every day to prevent infection. Thousands of miles away, the story of Toucan Gracia moved famous documentary filmmaker Paula Heredia and Discovery News producer John Hoffman. They chronicled the installation of Gracia's new beak and recorded a documentary, "Land of the Toucans," which was shown on Animal Planet this month. The documentary "Land of Toucans" shows how a tiny toucan can make a country change for itself, and how it can involve its citizens in the fight against animal cruelty.</div>

The influence of social networking is becoming more and more extensive, not only gradually replacing the traditional telephone contact, and even infiltrated into the real life circle offline, quietly changing people's social life. The benefits of online social networking are obvious, such as convenience and speed, making it particularly popular with young people. According to a survey on college students' social habits, 57 percent of college students spend more than five hours a day using their mobile phones. "Social networking has the characteristics of low cost, high transmission speed and multiple people communicating at the same time, which meets the needs of contemporary college students." Expanding the circle of relationships, having more equal conversations, and avoiding social concerns are the main reasons why we love online chatting more and more. Newcomers to the company love to communicate with colleagues online, "because they are not familiar with the unit, through the social platform praise comments, the relationship is much closer than before." Love to make friends is also commonly used online communication, "with friends before because of some misunderstanding did not contact for some time, and later in a large group of first dialogue a few words before they warm up again." <span class="highlighted">Wu Yan, an IT engineer, is a deep social network enthusiast. Most of his social life takes place online, with online contacts several times larger than the number of offline friends.</span> Wu Yan himself also admitted to being more "like a duck to water" on the Internet. "You can reply to a friend when it's convenient for you, because you have a lot of time to think about words and you can express them more clearly." "Hidden under the ID, you and I avoid face-to-face collisions, not only have room to maneuver, and even give each other more time and space to think about words and deeds." "People of different identities have the right and efficiency to speak the same way, and social concerns in real life seem to be dispelled in cyberspace." However, Wu Yan's friend Xiao Peng feels that Wu Yan in life is a "pretty boring house man." Xiao Peng and Wu Yan met in a large group because they were both active speakers and soon became familiar with each other. Xiao Peng feels that Wu Yan is different from the Internet, the language is boring, do not take the initiative to express their views, flipping over and over is a few words, "Oh, OK, is it", or "This I want to check on the Internet."</div>

The newcomers enjoy online communication with other employees, " because we are not familiar with each other at the beginning. But the 'like' and comment in the social media will close the distance."

"People of different status are given the same rights to speech and the same voice. Various social taboos in real life seem to disappear in the online world." Xiaopeng, a friend of Wu Yan, felt that the real life Wu Yan is a "boring geek". Xiaopeng and Wu Yan met in a big group. As they were both active speakers, they became acquainted very quickly.

UV rays not only darkens your skin but can also cause sunburn. So how does one get through the rigorous military training without sunburn? Sunscreen generally features a SPF and PA mark.

Any type of skin care products is not good for those with sensitive skin and a 100% pure sunscreen is recommended. It takes time for the sunscreen to seep in thus do not forget to apply the sunscreen 30 minutes beforehand. During the long military training, be sure to apply sunscreen once every two hours to keep it effective. Don't get lazy. The skin is exposed greatly to the sun during military training thus do not use skin whitening products right away.

For dry skin, use cream-based anti-sunburn products. Those with neutral skin are not subject to stringent regulations. However, sensitive skin will find application of any product to be a hard burden. Purely physical sunblock products are recommended. Remember to apply the sunblock cream half an hour earlier as the anti-sunburn product needs some time before completely penetrating the skin. Military training includes extended exposure to solar radiation. Anti-sunburn cream must be applied once every 2 hours to sustain the effects. Don't get lazy about this. Since the skin has just been sensitized by exposure to the sun, do not use whitening products immediately after military training. For sunburns endured during military training, ice wrapped in towels can be used to cool scorched skin and alleviate local senses of over-heating.</div>

	<div class="source" id="52">很多NBA球员都证明了自己的实力。但是有人进步就有人衰落。 无论是因为年龄的增大还是出场时间被限制，每个赛季都有一些球员的表现会出现退步。 当然了，有些“退步”可能仅仅是数据的缩水，这些球员的实力可能并未下降。 即便韦德仍是联盟里最好的得分后卫之一，但是他在公牛的表现应该不会有热火那么好了。 他和隆多组成的后场射程有限，当家球星巴特勒的三分命中率也只有32.8%，这让他们下赛季的进攻会打得很拥挤。 来到了风城，闪电侠势必把球权更多地让给巴特勒和隆多，自己很可能在常规赛选择养生打法。 奥卡福的情况比较尴尬，作为上赛季76人的第一选择，他在新赛季不得不和西蒙斯以及恩比德竞争上场时间和球权。 <span class="highlighted">这一竞争可能不会来的很快，西蒙斯还需要适应NBA赛场，恩比德也要尽快从伤病中完全恢复，但是奥卡福能否在76人的长人阵中有位置还是个问题。</span> 上个赛季，奥卡福32%的得分来自低位进攻，这一比例高于考辛斯、武切维奇和布鲁克·洛佩斯，同时他的使用率也高居联盟前40。 随着西蒙斯已经展现了出色的控球前锋潜质，恩比德也拥有着更适合NBA比赛的身材，奥卡福的地位恐怕很难再那么稳固了。 过去两个赛季，汤普森的使用率已经稳定在了联盟前20，而这也是他生涯最出色的两个赛季。 不过问题是，随着杜兰特的到来，汤普森的使用率一定会下降，这势必将影响他的发挥。 这一影响将不仅是出手次数的影响，汤神的持球进攻在下赛季肯定也会大大减少，这在某些方面也会降低对手对他的防守难度。 杜兰特的到来一定会让勇士队的球员们数据缩水，但这其中缩水最严重的恐怕就是汤普森了。 但这并不意味着汤神的水平退步，这更像是他为球队整体做出了牺牲。 帕克在上个赛季表现得比数据反映的要好些，不仅是因为他的篮下效率来到了生涯最高，他和阿尔德里奇的化学反应也让马刺队受益。 邓肯退役，吉诺比利宣布再战一年，GDP的组合最终也走到了尽头，作为三个人里最年轻的一个，法国跑车的油箱里也没有多少油了。 在得到了第三枚总冠军戒指之后，只有贾巴尔、乔丹和拉塞尔比詹姆斯赢得了更多的常规赛MVP，而乔丹是唯一一个FMVP比詹姆斯多的人。 哦，对了，詹姆斯刚刚为克利夫兰带来了过去52年里第一座职业体育冠军奖杯。 来到了职业生涯第14个赛季的詹姆斯需要更好的保证体力，为季后赛做好准备。 因此，在常规赛里，詹姆斯的数据很可能进一步下滑，他会把更多的重担分给欧文来承担，不过他仍然会轻松地成为联盟前三的球员。</div>
	<div class="translation" id="52">A lot of NBA players have proven themselves, but some have improved and others have declined. Whether it's because of increased age or limited playing time, there are a number of players who have regressed every season. Of course, some of the "regressions" may simply be data shrinkage, and the strength of these players may not have diminished. Even though Wade is still one of the best shooting guards in the league, he probably won't do as well with the Bulls as the Heat. He and Rondo have limited backcourt range and the establishment star Butler is shooting just 32.8 percent from three-point range, making their offense crowded for next season. Coming to Windy City, the Blitzkrieg is bound to cede more of the ball to Butler and Rondo, and he is likely to choose a regimen to play during the regular season. Okafor is in an awkward position, having to compete with Simmons and Embiid for playing time and ball rights in the new season as the first choice for the 76ers last season. <span class="highlighted">The rivalry may not come soon, Simmons will have to adapt to the NBA and Embiid will have to fully recover from the injury as soon as possible, but Okafor's place in the 76ers' lineup remains a question.</span> Okafor scored 32 percent from the low post offense last season, a higher percentage than Cousins, Vucevic and Brooke Lopez, while his usage rates were also high in the league's top 40. With Simmons already showing excellent possession forward potential and Embiid in better shape for NBA games, Okafor's position is likely to be hard to get any more secure. Thompson's usage has stabilized in the league's top 20 over the past two seasons, the best of his career. The problem, though, is that Thompson's usage is bound to decline with Durant's arrival, and that's bound to affect his play. The impact will be not only in terms of the number of shots taken, but the Towns' holding offense will certainly be significantly reduced next season, which in some ways will also make it easier for opponents to defend him. Durant's arrival is sure to shrink the Warriors' player numbers, but it's probably Thompson who has lost the most. But that doesn't mean that Tommy's level has regressed, it's more like he's made sacrifices for the team as a whole. Parker did better last season than the numbers suggest, not only because his basketball efficiency was at its highest in his career, but also because his chemistry with Aldridge benefited the Spurs. Duncan retired, Ginobili announced another year of fighting, and the GDP combination finally came to an end, and as the youngest of the three, the French sports car didn't have much fuel in its tank. After getting their third championship ring, only Abdul-Jabbar, Jordan and Russell won more regular-season MVPs than James, and Jordan was the only one with more than James. Oh, and by the way, James has just brought Cleveland its first Pro Sports Championship trophy in the last 52 years. James, who arrived in his 14th season of his career, needs to be better guaranteed physical strength and ready for the playoffs. As a result, James' numbers are likely to slide further during the regular season, and he'll share more of the burden with Irving, though he'll still be an easy top-three player in the league.</div>
	<div class="translation" id="52">Many NBA players are able to prove their ability to play but there are people who fall off. Whether it is due to age or limited playing time, there are always players who gets worse each season. Of course those deemed to have "gotten worse" may just be due to the limited stats and data, and they may actually not have gotten worse. Despite Dwayne Wade being one of the top shooting guards in the league, he will probably not perform as well with the Bulls than he did back with the Heat. The backcourt range of Wade and Rondo is limited and Butler who is the star player only has a 32.8% 3-point percentage. This will make their offence limited in the next season. In the windy city, the Flash (Wade) needs to give control of the ball more to Butler and Rondo, while he takes a more conservative approach and stay healthy. Okafor's situation is more awkward. Despite being the number one draft for the 76ers last season, he has to compete with Simmons and Embiid for playing time and ball in the upcoming season. <span class="highlighted">Playing for the spot won't be right away as Simmons still needs to get used to the NBA games, and Embiid need to quickly recover from injuries. The issue remains if Okafor will be able to stay in the 76'ers roster in the long run.</span> Last season, Okafor' was scoring 32% from the low post, which is higher than Cousins, Vucevic, and Brook Lopez. He also has a usage rate of 40 in the league. With Simmons already showing excellent potential as a forward, and Embiid having good potential for the NBA, it may be difficult for Okafor to find a stable role. In the past two seasons, Thompson's usage rate has stabilized at the top 20 in the league, and his last two seasons has been the best in his career. However, with Durant joining the team, the issues would be that Thompson's use rate will certainly decline, and is bound to affect his performance. This will impact his shots taken and will surely reduce greatly next season and make the opponent defend him easier. The arrival of Durant will limit the stats of the Warrior's players, and the player that would be the most affected would most likely be Thompson. But this does not mean Thompson's playing ability will get worse. It is more a matter of fact that he will need to make some sacrifice for the team. Parker performed better than the data reflected last season, not only because his efficiency was at the highest level of his career, but his chemistry with Aldridge also benefited the Spurs. With Duncan retiring and Ginobili playing one last season, the era of Ginobili, Duncan and Parker will finally come to an end. As the youngest of the three, there is not much gas left in the tank for the French import. After winning the third championship ring, only Jabbar, Jordan and Russell and James won more regular-season MVPs, and Jordan is the only person with more Finals MVP than James. Oh and James has just brought home Cleveland's first professional sports championship cup in 52 years. In LeBron's 14 season of his career, he will need to maintain his physical condition to prepare for the playoffs. His stats will probably decline in the regular season as give the ball more to Osman. However, he will still easily be the top three players in the league.</div>
	<div class="translation" id="52">Many NBA players have proven themselves, but progress for some meant regress for others. Due to aging or restrictions on playing time, performance of several players may become worse for each season. Of course, some of this "degeneration" could be attributed to lowered statistics, but the true ability of these players probably stayed the same. Although Wade is still regarded as one of the best shooting guards in the NBA, his performance with the Bulls will unlikely be as good as when he was at Miami Heat. He and Rondo has limited perimeter shot range, and their superstar Butler only has a 32.8% chance of scoring with a three-point shot. Offenses they head for the next season will be extremely crowded. After arriving at the Windy City, Wade "the Lightning" will, where possible, pass the ball to Butler and Rondo while he himself adopts a more wholesome gameplay strategy in conventional games. Okafor's position is quite precarious. As the only option for the 76ers in the last season, he was forced to jostle with Simons and Embiid for play time and ownership of the ball during the new season. <span class="highlighted">This competition may not be imminent. Simmons still has to adapt to the NBA game. Embiid also has to fully recover from his injuries as soon as possible. Whether Okafor will hold a permanent position in the 76ers however, remains questionable.</span> In the previous season, Okafor's 32% scoring rate was attributed to low post offense. This ratio was higher than that of Cousins, Vučević, and Brook Lopez. His usage rate is also amongst the top-40 of the entire NBA. As Simmons has demonstrated great potential as a point forward and Embiid is starting to get a physique more suitable for NBA games, Okafor's position will only become less stable. For the last two seasons, Thompson has been one of the top-20 most commonly fielded players in the NBA. Those were his most impressive two seasons in his entire career. The problem is that with the arrival of Durant, the chance for having Thompson play in the games will definitely drop, further lowering his chances of performing. This not only affected the chances for Thompson to play the game, his field goal attempts will be vastly reduced in the next season, and reduce the challenges faced by his opponents when defending against him. The arrival of Durant will definitely result in a drop in numbers among Warriors' players, but Thompson will probably have the most to lose. This does not mean that Thompson's standards have dropped. In fact, it appears that he's making sacrifices for the sake of the entire team. Parker's performance last season was better than his stats suggested. Not only did Parker achieve his career best in rebound efficiency, his chemistry with Aldridge also benefited the Spurs. Duncan has retired, while Ginóbili announced that he will play for another year. The GDP combination has finally come to an end. As the youngest of the three, there is little gas in the tank of the French sports car. Only Jabbar, Jordan, and Russell won more standard MVP games than James after obtaining their third championship rings. Jordan is the only person with more FMVP than James. O yes, James has just helped deliver the first professional sports championship trophy to Cleveland in 52 years. James, who is in the 14th season of his professional career, needs to better retain his physical strength to prepare well for the playoffs. Therefore, during the regular season, James' stats may well decline further. He will share more of his burden with Owen but he will easily remain one of the top 3 NBA players.</div>

	<div class="translation" id="53"><span class="highlighted">Gracia is a budding female toucan with the scent of a tropical rainforest.</span> In the Central American country of Costa Rica, the toucan Gracia and its story have long been a household name. At a press conference on August 10, Gracia, who is recovering from surgery, finally appeared to show off her brand-new, 3D printed plastic beak. The dying toucan, which had its beak snapped off a year and a half ago, has been given a new lease of life. This day heralds not only its 100 per cent return to health, but also its move into the luxurious aviary and its meeting with human friends who care about it. Gracia, who had just entered her new home, was a little shy, but soon became active, wallowing in the basin and eating the grapes with her new beak. To remind people of the damage it has suffered, instead of painting its new beak, technicians have kept the original white of the 3D printing material. The beak is covered with a thin, horny sheath that is hollow inside, with only a few thin, bone-supporting poles interlaced. Despite this internal reinforcement, the toucan's beak is still fragile and will break when it is damaged. The Animal Rescue Center, ornithologists and an American 3D printing company worked together to create several "experimental beaks" for Gracia, finally creating the "perfect beak" for her. Gracia is now adept at using her new beak to drink, eat and even pick up tiny grains. "The final product took about two months to design and only four or five hours to print." "3D printing is not the technology of the future, it has really come into your life and mine," Thomas Langer, chairman of SG3D printing company, told Xinhua International. Gracia, a toucan covered in blood, was discovered on a farm in Gracia, in the central Alajuela province of Costa Rica, in January 2015. At that time, its beak was brutally broken by a group of young people, it was completely unable to eat, life-threatening. The tragedy in Gracia has caused a flurry of calls against animal cruelty in and around Costa Rica after media reports. There have been calls for stricter animal protection laws and greater penalties for abusers. People came spontaneously and did their best to help Gracia get back to life as much as possible before the injury. Even Chuck Hull, the inventor of 3D printing technology, was involved in the design of Gracia's upper beak. "The case of Gracia is unique in that the remaining part of its upper beak is less than one centimetre, which makes it difficult to install a new beak," he said. "We scanned Gracia and then designed and made an extended prosthesis that was slightly longer than the rest of her upper beak. "This will reduce further invasive damage to Gracia," Langer told Xinhua International. Before installing the prosthesis, staff had to clean up Gracia's beak every day to prevent infection. Thousands of miles away, the story of Toucan Gracia moved famous documentary filmmaker Paula Heredia and Discovery News producer John Hoffman. They chronicled the installation of Gracia's new beak and recorded a documentary, "Land of the Toucans," which was shown on Animal Planet this month. The documentary "Land of Toucans" shows how a tiny toucan can make a country change for itself, and how it can involve its citizens in the fight against animal cruelty.</div>
	<div class="translation" id="53"><span class="highlighted">Gracia is a cute female toucan with the scent of the jungle about her.</span> In the Central American country of Costa Rica, the toucan Gracia and its story are extremely well-known. The August 10 press conference finally revealed Gracia after recovering from the operation, displaying its brand new 3D-printed plastic beak. This toucan whose upper beak was broken by someone, and which was on the brink of death, has now finally received a new lease of life. This is the day that the bird has reached 100% recovery and the day when it could be moved to a luxurious bird house and meet its human friends who have been caring for it. Gracia appears to be rather shy after moving to her new home, but quickly revealed her lively side, playing in the pool of water and using her new beak to eat grapes. To remind people of the abuse it once suffered, the technicians did not color its new beak, but kept it white, the original color of the 3D printing material. The external layer of the beak is a thin keratin sheath. The beak is hollow and only reinforced by thin, criss-crossing supporting struts of bone. Although reinforced internally, the toucan's beak is still fragile, and will crack when it is harmed. The animal aid center, an ornithologist, and a 3D printing company from the United States are working together, making several "experimental beaks" for Gracia before creating the "perfect beak" that best suits the bird. Now Gracia has become proficient in using her beak to drink, eat, and even pick up fine seed grains. "The design of the final product took about two months; printing took just four to five hours." "3D printing is not for next generation. It has become part of our life." Thomas Lange, President of SG3D told the  Xinhua News Agency. On January 2015, Gracia the toucan was found, bleeding from its mouth, by a person in a farm at Gracia, Alajuela Province in central Costa Rica. At the time, its upper beak was cruelly broken by a group of youths. It could not eat and was dying. Once reported in mass media, Gracia's sad state initiated a wave of outcry against animal abuse in and outside Costa Rica. The public requested more rigorous animal protection laws to be established, and punishment for abusers to be stepped out. People came forward voluntarily, and did the best they could to help Grecia regain its life prior to the injury. Even Chuck Hull, the inventor of 3D printing technology, also contributed towards the design of Gracia's upper beak. "Gracia's condition is quite unique. Less than 1 cm of its upper beak has remained, making it difficult to install a new beak." "We first scanned Gracia and then designed and manufactured an extended prosthetic that is slightly longer than its remaining upper beak. The prosthetic is then glued to its upper beak." "This will help reduce further invasive injury on Grecia," Lange told a XInhua international news reporter. Prior to installing the prosthetics, workers cleaned the broken beak for Gracia everyday to prevent infections. Thousands of miles away, the story of Gracia the toucan has moved renowned documentary filmmaker Paula Heredia and investigative journalist John Hoffman. Toucan Nation is a documentary that recorded in detail the process of fitting a new beak for Grecia, which was broadcast on Animal Planet this month. The documentary Toucan Nation showed how a small toucan bird could change a country and encourage every citizen to participate in the movement against animal abuse.</div>
	<div class="translation" id="53"><span class="highlighted">Grecia is an adorable female toucan that exudes a tropical feel.</span> The story of Grecia the toucan has been known early on in the Central American country of Costa Rica. In the press release on August 30th, Grecia who recovered from the surgery showed off her new prosthetic 3D printed beak to the public. The toucan whose beak was hacked off by humans and was dying a year and half ago is now reborn. This day not only confirms that she is 100% healthy, but also is a day when she will be relocated to a luxurious cage and a day for those who care about her to be able to see her. Grecia was a bit shy after moving to her new home but became more lively as she played in the water and ate grapes with her new beak. The engineering specialist did not newly paint the 3D printed beak to serve as a reminder to people of what she went through, thus leaving it in the original white color of the 3D printing material. The outer layer of the beak features a thin wall of keratin, and the inside is generally hollow and is only supported by several thin bone struts. Despite the interior being reinforced, the toucan's beak is still frail and can break when damaged. With the collaboration with the animal rescue center, bird specialists, and a US 3D printing company, the group was able to create several "trial versions" to identify and finally create "the perfect one". Grecia can now skillfully use her new beak to drink water, eat, and even pick up small grains. "The design of the final product took around 2 months and the printing only took 4-5 hours." The president of SG3D Printing, Thomas Lange explained to Xinhua International during an interview that, "3D printing is not a technology of the future but has already stepped in to our lives". In January 2015, a bloodied toucan (Grecia) was found on a farm in Grecia, Alajuela Province located in central Costa Rica. The beak was brutally hacked off by a group of youngsters. She could not eat at all and was in critical condition. After the media covered the story of Grecia's tragic situation, it triggered a wave of opposition on animal cruelty in and outside of Costa Rica. People have since called out for a stricter animal protection law and for harsher penalties for animal abuse. People proactively came together to do their best to help Grecia recover and regain her life before being injured. Chuck Hall who is the inventor of 3D printing was also involved in the design of Grecia's beak. "Grecia's situation was a very special one as there was less than 1 cm of the upper jaw left, which caused many difficulties in attaching the beak." "We first scanned Grecia then designed an extended cap that was a bit longer than the remnant beak, then glued the prosthetic beak". Lange told the reporters of Xinhua International that "By doing so, we can prevent further injury for Grecia". Before installing the prosthetic beak, the staff had to keep Grecia clean everyday to prevent infections. The story of Grecia the toucan travelled the distance and touched John Hoffman who is a producer at Discovery News Channel and Paul Heredia who is a famous documentary director. They filmed bits and pieces of the installation of Grecia's new beak to make a documentary called "Toucan Nation" which was aired on Animal Planet this month.

	<div class="translation" id="55">The Young Zhang Binbin from Xiamen: She started her shooting career as she had "Beautiful Hands" and went through various "struggles". Zhang Donghong from Dongyuan Village in Xiang'an District of Xiamen just replaced an old 29-inch TV with a 65-inch TV at his home. This average farmer's daughter is Zhang Binbin who won the silver medal in the 50 meter rifle three positions event at the Rio Olympic Games for China on the evening of the 11th. Zhang Donghong and his wife along with a number of friends and family were in front of the new TV on the night of the 11th to witness their daughter make a miraculous comeback from almost being eliminated In the day of the event, Zhang Binbin was at one point in the lower part of the ranking and did not seem she would reach the finals. However her parents and close friends did not give up on her as they kept their eyes on the text of the broadcast. Upon seeing other players finishing and where they were ranked, they saw Binbin's name go up the rank and secured a seat in the finals, when the families and friends burst in cheers at home. In the finals, she was on the bottom end of the ranking but her last few shots got more stable and won the silver medal with only 0.2 points behind the champion. For Zhang Binbin who is already 27, it was a hard-fought silver medal in her 16 years of her shooting career. <span class="highlighted">Zhang's mother, Xiaolong told the reporters that when they felt hesitant about her doing this, Zhang Binbin brought a group of "young kids" from the same village to persuade her parents.</span> The "young kids" were from the same village who were also recommended to participate in the training at the same time. Among them was Zhang Binbin's cousin. However, shortly after joining the Xiamen team, Zhang Binbin decided to go back to school in Xiang'an to study due to family hardships. But after the coach Zhang Yajie, kept convincing her, she returned to the Xiamen team again. After being in the provincial team, Zhang Binbin once again failed to get in the national team. As she could not see hope in getting in, she returned home once again. This time, not only coach Zhang, but also the managers and coaches of the Xiamen Shooting and Archery Sports Center and the Fujian provincial team came to her home to persuade Zhang Binbin to return to the provincial team. Like yesterday's game, she persisted and overcame the hurdles in her shooting career. "The way a coach decides who makes the team is different. However for me, I knew she was it when I saw Zhang Binbin's hands." Zhang Donhong also remembered that during the test in the training, despite her scores not being the best, her points were very consistent which was the reason the coaches were fond of Zhang Binbin. In the process of training Zhang Binbin, Zhang Yajie remembered clearly the input provided by this farm girl. He recalls that around 1 year after Zhang Binbin joined the Xiamen Shooting team, the team had a endurance training exercise where they were not allowed to move for half an hour. Zhang Xiaolong told the reporters that her daughter was always a quiet and obedient girl who liked to draw and play with homemade toys when she was small. "When I would sew and repair clothes at home, Binbin would use the scrap pieces and make a doll herself. She said that her daughter would often sew her own toys. As she also liked to draw, the facial expression and the clothes of the dolls she made looked really good. As an athlete, Zhang Binbin saw her family less and less, and would only go back home during the holidays, and usually contacted each other by phone. Her parents said that regardless of being together or on the phone, she would seldom talk about her hardship and would mostly talk about something happy with her parents. As they aren't able to see their daughter often, they make sure to carefully keep the drawings she made when she was little at home. Zhang Xiaolong showed a comic drawn by her daughter to the reporter and said "if she didn't become a shooter, she would have probably continued drawing." In the living room on the second floor of Zhang Binbin's house, there is a cupboard full of medals, and certificates she has won. Zhang Donghong arranged the medals neatly, and the certificates in a folder. “These are the result of Binbin's hard work in these 10 years and so, and are very precious to us."</div>
	<div class="translation" id="55">Zhang Binbin, a daughter of Xiamen, had "wonderful hand posture" and experienced multiple "reversals" during her career as a shooter. Zhang Donghong, a resident at Dongyuan Village at Xiang'an District in Xiamen, just swapped his old 29-inch television for a large 65-inch set several days ago. This daughter of a common farmer is Zhang Binbin, who just won a silver medal for China in the 50 meter rifle three positions in the Rio Olympics. During the evening of the 11th, Zhang Donghong, his wife, and dozens of other family members and friends stood before this new television and witnessed how his daughter started a miraculous spree that brought her from the brink of being dropped out of the competition to a medal winning score. On the day of the competition, Zhang Binbin had a mid to low ranking at one point, and a spot in the final appeared extremely remote. Parents, family, and friends did not give up, and continued to watch to live stream. When the other athletes completed their firing, Zhang Binbin's rank kept rising until she secured the right to compete in the finals. Everyone at her home exploded in a great cheer. In the finals, Zhang Binbin, who again fell behind in the rankings at one point, became increasingly steady as she fired the last few shots. She finished just 0.2 points behind the champion, clinching the silver medal. Across her 16-year shooting career, Zhang Binbin, who is 27-year old this year, brushed past this hard-won silver medal on several occasions. <span class="highlighted">The mother, Zhang Xiaolong, told the reporter that when everyone was still hesitant, Zhang Binbin found several "young persuaders" from the same village.</span> The "little lobbyists" are the kids from the same family participated the training by recommendation at hat time, including the cousin of Zhang Binbin.

Zhang Donghong also recalled that although his daughter's performance was not the best at the group training test, the number of rounds she shot was very stable. This was also a key factor why Zhang Binbin attracted the attention of her coach. During training, the farm girl Zhang Binbin was so committed that she left a lasting impression with Zhang Yajie. He recollected that more than one year after Zhang Binbin joined the Xiamen shooting team, the team conducted a standing posture rifle firing training. Team members were required to stand still for half an hour. Zhang Xiaolong told the reporter that her daughter is a quiet and obedient child and has loved drawing and making her own toys since a young age. "Originally, I stayed at home to tailor some clothes, sewing and mending them as needed. Binbin would sit by the corner, collecting the scrap fabrics to make her own fabric doll." She said that her daughter would often sew and make her own toys. Coupled with the fact that she was good at drawing, she was able to create a lifelike face and clothing for the dolls she made. As an athlete, Zhang Binbin spends little time with family, and could only return home during weekends and public holidays. Usually, they communicate using the telephone. Her parents said that whether when meeting in person or talking on the phone, Zhang Binbin seldom said she found things difficult. More often than not, she would chat about happy things with parents. Since they hardly see their daughter, the parents carefully preserved the artwork that their girl has made as a child and the glories that she had later won. Zhang Xiaolong showed the reporter the cartoon artwork his daughter created. "If she didn't become a archer, she would probably continue to draw." There is a cabinet located at the second floor living room in Zhang Binbin's home that is filled with the plaques, medals, and certificates that she had won. Zhang Donghong displayed the medals and awards neatly, and kept all the certificates in a folder. "These are the honors Binbin has received over the years on the basis of her hard work and dedication. All of us cherish them."</div>

Zhang Donghong, a resident at Dongyuan Village at Xiang'an District in Xiamen, just swapped his old 29-inch television for a large 65-inch set several days ago. This daughter of a common farmer is Zhang Binbin, who just won a silver medal for China in the 50 meter rifle three positions in the Rio Olympics. During the evening of the 11th, Zhang Donghong, his wife, and dozens of other family members and friends stood before this new television and witnessed how his daughter started a miraculous spree that brought her from the brink of being dropped out of the competition to a medal winning score. On the day of the competition, Zhang Binbin had a mid to low ranking at one point, and a spot in the final appeared extremely remote. Parents, family, and friends did not give up, and continued to watch to live stream. When the other athletes completed their firing, Zhang Binbin's rank kept rising until she secured the right to compete in the finals. Everyone at her home exploded in a great cheer. In the finals, Zhang Binbin, who again fell behind in the rankings at one point, became increasingly steady as she fired the last few shots. She finished just 0.2 points behind the champion, clinching the silver medal. Across her 16-year shooting career, Zhang Binbin, who is 27-year old this year, brushed past this hard-won silver medal on several occasions.

At the time, I noticed that Binbin has really nice hands, and fell in love with them immediately." Zhang Donghong also recalled that although his daughter's performance was not the best at the group training test, the number of rounds she shot was very stable. This was also a key factor why Zhang Binbin attracted the attention of her coach. During training, the farm girl Zhang Binbin was so committed that she left a lasting impression with Zhang Yajie. He recollected that more than one year after Zhang Binbin joined the Xiamen shooting team, the team conducted a standing posture rifle firing training. Team members were required to stand still for half an hour. Zhang Xiaolong told the reporter that her daughter is a quiet and obedient child and has loved drawing and making her own toys since a young age. "Originally, I stayed at home to tailor some clothes, sewing and mending them as needed. Binbin would sit by the corner, collecting the scrap fabrics to make her own fabric doll." She said that her daughter would often sew and make her own toys. Coupled with the fact that she was good at drawing, she was able to create a lifelike face and clothing for the dolls she made. As an athlete, Zhang Binbin spends little time with family, and could only return home during weekends and public holidays. Usually, they communicate using the telephone. Her parents said that whether when meeting in person or talking on the phone, Zhang Binbin seldom said she found things difficult. More often than not, she would chat about happy things with parents. Since they hardly see their daughter, the parents carefully preserved the artwork that their girl has made as a child and the glories that she had later won. Zhang Xiaolong showed the reporter the cartoon artwork his daughter created. "If she didn't become a archer, she would probably continue to draw." There is a cabinet located at the second floor living room in Zhang Binbin's home that is filled with the plaques, medals, and certificates that she had won. Zhang Donghong displayed the medals and awards neatly, and kept all the certificates in a folder. "These are the honors Binbin has received over the years on the basis of her hard work and dedication. All of us cherish them."</div>

	<div class="translation" id="58">The Young Zhang Binbin from Xiamen: She started her shooting career as she had "Beautiful Hands" and went through various "struggles". Zhang Donghong from Dongyuan Village in Xiang'an District of Xiamen just replaced an old 29-inch TV with a 65-inch TV at his home. This average farmer's daughter is Zhang Binbin who won the silver medal in the 50 meter rifle three positions event at the Rio Olympic Games for China on the evening of the 11th. Zhang Donghong and his wife along with a number of friends and family were in front of the new TV on the night of the 11th to witness their daughter make a miraculous comeback from almost being eliminated In the day of the event, Zhang Binbin was at one point in the lower part of the ranking and did not seem she would reach the finals. However her parents and close friends did not give up on her as they kept their eyes on the text of the broadcast. Upon seeing other players finishing and where they were ranked, they saw Binbin's name go up the rank and secured a seat in the finals, when the families and friends burst in cheers at home. In the finals, she was on the bottom end of the ranking but her last few shots got more stable and won the silver medal with only 0.2 points behind the champion. For Zhang Binbin who is already 27, it was a hard-fought silver medal in her 16 years of her shooting career. Zhang's mother, Xiaolong told the reporters that when they felt hesitant about her doing this, Zhang Binbin brought a group of "young kids" from the same village to persuade her parents. The "young kids" were from the same village who were also recommended to participate in the training at the same time. Among them was Zhang Binbin's cousin. However, shortly after joining the Xiamen team, Zhang Binbin decided to go back to school in Xiang'an to study due to family hardships. But after the coach Zhang Yajie, kept convincing her, she returned to the Xiamen team again. <span class="highlighted">After being in the provincial team, Zhang Binbin once again failed to get in the national team.

Like yesterday's game, she persisted and overcame the hurdles in her shooting career. "The way a coach decides who makes the team is different. However for me, I knew she was it when I saw Zhang Binbin's hands." Zhang Donhong also remembered that during the test in the training, despite her scores not being the best, her points were very consistent which was the reason the coaches were fond of Zhang Binbin. In the process of training Zhang Binbin, Zhang Yajie remembered clearly the input provided by this farm girl.

Zhang Xiaolong told the reporters that her daughter was always a quiet and obedient girl who liked to draw and play with homemade toys when she was small. "When I would sew and repair clothes at home, Binbin would use the scrap pieces and make a doll herself. She said that her daughter would often sew her own toys. As she also liked to draw, the facial expression and the clothes of the dolls she made looked really good. As an athlete, Zhang Binbin saw her family less and less, and would only go back home during the holidays, and usually contacted each other by phone. Her parents said that regardless of being together or on the phone, she would seldom talk about her hardship and would mostly talk about something happy with her parents. As they aren't able to see their daughter often, they make sure to carefully keep the drawings she made when she was little at home. Zhang Xiaolong showed a comic drawn by her daughter to the reporter and said "if she didn't become a shooter, she would have probably continued drawing." In the living room on the second floor of Zhang Binbin's house, there is a cupboard full of medals, and certificates she has won. Zhang Donghong arranged the medals neatly, and the certificates in a folder. “These are the result of Binbin's hard work in these 10 years and so, and are very precious to us."</div>

These include the falsifying the clarity to increase the price, falsifying the weight of diamonds, and the lack of warranty. Antwerp is one of the largest diamond trading centers in the world, and is known for their diamond cutting technology by local craftsmen. The diamonds sold have been thoroughly appraised and are favored by ladies from the mainland. <span class="highlighted">"A small cloth bag floating in the palm of your hand is worth nearly one million yuan," said Liu, who purchased diamonds there. She described to the mainland media in regards to her experiences in Antwerp this June.</span> She explained that she hid the diamonds in her underwear and always kept it by her everyday even when she went to the washroom or shower; was very cautious when going out or sleeping. She said that the diamonds she bought in Antwerp retailed 55,000 yuan per carat, while the diamonds of the same quality in Xiamen would cost around 111,000 yuan. She sold all of the recently purchased diamonds at a 20% premium, and made 200,000 yuan just like that. According to the regulations of the Mainland Customs, diamonds are not articles or supplies necessitated by the traveler. Therefore, diamonds are regarded as a good and must be declared when they leave or enter the country. Otherwise, it may be considered as smuggling and face potential jail time.</div>
	<div class="translation" id="61">August 12 news report by Oriental Daily, a Hong Kong news company, said that there are 3 major issues of diamond sales in Mainland China. This includes false labeling of diamond purity to drive up prices, false labeling of diamond mass, and lack of post-sales guarantee. Antwerp is the largest diamond trading center in the world. Diamond cutting skills of local craftsman are famous throughout the world.

She sold all the diamonds she purchased as agent at a 20% premium to the purchase price, and made a huge lump-sum profit of 200,000 yuan.

	<div class="translation" id="65">Grecia is an adorable female toucan that exudes a tropical feel. The story of Grecia the toucan has been known early on in the Central American country of Costa Rica. In the press release on August 30th, Grecia who recovered from the surgery showed off her new prosthetic 3D printed beak to the public. The toucan whose beak was hacked off by humans and was dying a year and half ago is now reborn. This day not only confirms that she is 100% healthy, but also is a day when she will be relocated to a luxurious cage and a day for those who care about her to be able to see her. Grecia was a bit shy after moving to her new home but became more lively as she played in the water and ate grapes with her new beak. The engineering specialist did not newly paint the 3D printed beak to serve as a reminder to people of what she went through, thus leaving it in the original white color of the 3D printing material. The outer layer of the beak features a thin wall of keratin, and the inside is generally hollow and is only supported by several thin bone struts. Despite the interior being reinforced, the toucan's beak is still frail and can break when damaged. With the collaboration with the animal rescue center, bird specialists, and a US 3D printing company, the group was able to create several "trial versions" to identify and finally create "the perfect one". Grecia can now skillfully use her new beak to drink water, eat, and even pick up small grains. "The design of the final product took around 2 months and the printing only took 4-5 hours." The president of SG3D Printing, Thomas Lange explained to Xinhua International during an interview that, "3D printing is not a technology of the future but has already stepped in to our lives". In January 2015, a bloodied toucan (Grecia) was found on a farm in Grecia, Alajuela Province located in central Costa Rica. The beak was brutally hacked off by a group of youngsters. She could not eat at all and was in critical condition. After the media covered the story of Grecia's tragic situation, it triggered a wave of opposition on animal cruelty in and outside of Costa Rica. People have since called out for a stricter animal protection law and for harsher penalties for animal abuse. People proactively came together to do their best to help Grecia recover and regain her life before being injured. <span class="highlighted">Chuck Hall who is the inventor of 3D printing was also involved in the design of Grecia's beak.</span> "Grecia's situation was a very special one as there was less than 1 cm of the upper jaw left, which caused many difficulties in attaching the beak." "We first scanned Grecia then designed an extended cap that was a bit longer than the remnant beak, then glued the prosthetic beak". Lange told the reporters of Xinhua International that "By doing so, we can prevent further injury for Grecia". Before installing the prosthetic beak, the staff had to keep Grecia clean everyday to prevent infections. The story of Grecia the toucan travelled the distance and touched John Hoffman who is a producer at Discovery News Channel and Paul Heredia who is a famous documentary director. They filmed bits and pieces of the installation of Grecia's new beak to make a documentary called "Toucan Nation" which was aired on Animal Planet this month. The documentary "Toucan Nation" shows how a small Toucan inspired a nation to make changes and citizens to get involved to stop animal cruelty.</div>
	<div class="translation" id="65">Gracia is a budding female toucan with the scent of a tropical rainforest. In the Central American country of Costa Rica, the toucan Gracia and its story have long been a household name. At a press conference on August 10, Gracia, who is recovering from surgery, finally appeared to show off her brand-new, 3D printed plastic beak. The dying toucan, which had its beak snapped off a year and a half ago, has been given a new lease of life. This day heralds not only its 100 per cent return to health, but also its move into the luxurious aviary and its meeting with human friends who care about it. Gracia, who had just entered her new home, was a little shy, but soon became active, wallowing in the basin and eating the grapes with her new beak. To remind people of the damage it has suffered, instead of painting its new beak, technicians have kept the original white of the 3D printing material. The beak is covered with a thin, horny sheath that is hollow inside, with only a few thin, bone-supporting poles interlaced. Despite this internal reinforcement, the toucan's beak is still fragile and will break when it is damaged. The Animal Rescue Center, ornithologists and an American 3D printing company worked together to create several "experimental beaks" for Gracia, finally creating the "perfect beak" for her. Gracia is now adept at using her new beak to drink, eat and even pick up tiny grains. "The final product took about two months to design and only four or five hours to print." "3D printing is not the technology of the future, it has really come into your life and mine," Thomas Langer, chairman of SG3D printing company, told Xinhua International. Gracia, a toucan covered in blood, was discovered on a farm in Gracia, in the central Alajuela province of Costa Rica, in January 2015. At that time, its beak was brutally broken by a group of young people, it was completely unable to eat, life-threatening. The tragedy in Gracia has caused a flurry of calls against animal cruelty in and around Costa Rica after media reports. There have been calls for stricter animal protection laws and greater penalties for abusers. People came spontaneously and did their best to help Gracia get back to life as much as possible before the injury. <span class="highlighted">Even Chuck Hull, the inventor of 3D printing technology, was involved in the design of Gracia's upper beak.</span> "The case of Gracia is unique in that the remaining part of its upper beak is less than one centimetre, which makes it difficult to install a new beak," he said. "We scanned Gracia and then designed and made an extended prosthesis that was slightly longer than the rest of her upper beak. "This will reduce further invasive damage to Gracia," Langer told Xinhua International. Before installing the prosthesis, staff had to clean up Gracia's beak every day to prevent infection. Thousands of miles away, the story of Toucan Gracia moved famous documentary filmmaker Paula Heredia and Discovery News producer John Hoffman. They chronicled the installation of Gracia's new beak and recorded a documentary, "Land of the Toucans," which was shown on Animal Planet this month. The documentary "Land of Toucans" shows how a tiny toucan can make a country change for itself, and how it can involve its citizens in the fight against animal cruelty.</div>
	<div class="translation" id="65">Gracia is a cute female toucan with the scent of the jungle about her. In the Central American country of Costa Rica, the toucan Gracia and its story are extremely well-known. The August 10 press conference finally revealed Gracia after recovering from the operation, displaying its brand new 3D-printed plastic beak. This toucan whose upper beak was broken by someone, and which was on the brink of death, has now finally received a new lease of life. This is the day that the bird has reached 100% recovery and the day when it could be moved to a luxurious bird house and meet its human friends who have been caring for it. Gracia appears to be rather shy after moving to her new home, but quickly revealed her lively side, playing in the pool of water and using her new beak to eat grapes. To remind people of the abuse it once suffered, the technicians did not color its new beak, but kept it white, the original color of the 3D printing material. The external layer of the beak is a thin keratin sheath. The beak is hollow and only reinforced by thin, criss-crossing supporting struts of bone. Although reinforced internally, the toucan's beak is still fragile, and will crack when it is harmed. The animal aid center, an ornithologist, and a 3D printing company from the United States are working together, making several "experimental beaks" for Gracia before creating the "perfect beak" that best suits the bird. Now Gracia has become proficient in using her beak to drink, eat, and even pick up fine seed grains. "The design of the final product took about two months; printing took just four to five hours." "3D printing is not for next generation. It has become part of our life." Thomas Lange, President of SG3D told the  Xinhua News Agency. On January 2015, Gracia the toucan was found, bleeding from its mouth, by a person in a farm at Gracia, Alajuela Province in central Costa Rica. At the time, its upper beak was cruelly broken by a group of youths. It could not eat and was dying. Once reported in mass media, Gracia's sad state initiated a wave of outcry against animal abuse in and outside Costa Rica. The public requested more rigorous animal protection laws to be established, and punishment for abusers to be stepped out. People came forward voluntarily, and did the best they could to help Grecia regain its life prior to the injury. <span class="highlighted">Even Chuck Hull, the inventor of 3D printing technology, also contributed towards the design of Gracia's upper beak.</span> "Gracia's condition is quite unique. Less than 1 cm of its upper beak has remained, making it difficult to install a new beak." "We first scanned Gracia and then designed and manufactured an extended prosthetic that is slightly longer than its remaining upper beak. The prosthetic is then glued to its upper beak." "This will help reduce further invasive injury on Grecia," Lange told a XInhua international news reporter. Prior to installing the prosthetics, workers cleaned the broken beak for Gracia everyday to prevent infections. Thousands of miles away, the story of Gracia the toucan has moved renowned documentary filmmaker Paula Heredia and investigative journalist John Hoffman. Toucan Nation is a documentary that recorded in detail the process of fitting a new beak for Grecia, which was broadcast on Animal Planet this month. The documentary Toucan Nation showed how a small toucan bird could change a country and encourage every citizen to participate in the movement against animal abuse.</div>

	<div class="translation" id="69">Qingdao is the 12th in China and the first pilot city of paid use and trading of emission rights in Shandong Province. 11, a number of enterprises came to Qingdao Municipal Emission Trading Center to submit applications for the purchase of emission rights, purchase acceptance will pay a fee. The transaction is about to complete the first single also indicates that Qingdao emissions trading pilot work officially kicked off, which will be the province's emissions trading first single and the first nationwide city-level emissions trading. On the morning of November 11, Zhao Xiuping, general manager of Qingdao Shuangtao Fine Chemical Industry (Group) Co., Ltd. came to Qingdao Emission Trading Center to submit the application for emission rights. The enterprise is located in the old city of Qingdao plant at the end of last year to stop production, environmental protection moved to the new plant in Pingdu. After Zhao Xiuping submitted the application form, the environmental impact statement of the construction project and other materials, the Qingdao Municipal Emission Right Reserve and Trading Service Center began the preliminary examination of the application materials. According to Qingdao prices, finance and other departments to determine the collection standards, the current estimated initial sewage right to use about 644.12 million yuan, staff will be completed within seven working days to verify. The transaction is about to complete the first single also indicates that Qingdao emission trading pilot work officially kicked off, will also be the province's emission trading first single and the first national city-level emissions trading. Zhao Xiuping said: At present, enterprises have invested 400 million in environmental protection, a huge amount on the surface, but the concept of business management, social benefits have a great impact on the enterprise innovation and management has also opened up space. On the same day, Qingdao Sifang Xinchengzhizhuo Bus Accessories Co., Ltd. has also come to the annual output of 4,200 high-speed rail and EMU interior accessories projects to purchase emission rights. The project belongs to the mechanical processing enterprises, the application for the initial emission of chemical oxygen demand (COD) 0.514 tons / year, ammonia nitrogen (NOX) 0.052 tons / year. Air pollutant emission rights paid use and trade for the city's electricity, thermal production and supply of key industrial enterprises. <span class="highlighted">Existing units that have obtained an EIA prior to January 1, 2016, will not be charged a toll fee for the time being.</span> "Paid access to emission permits is not the same as access to the power of illegal discharge of pollutants, and can not be arbitrarily discharged pollutants." Han Hongyan, deputy director of Qingdao Municipal Environmental Protection Bureau, said that if illegal discharge, excessive discharge should still be punished in accordance with the relevant regulations, it is impossible to allow illegal enterprises through the purchase of pollution rights to avoid punishment. In other words, through legal means to crack down on environmental violations, and severely punish enterprises for excessive pollution, so as to protect the environment and protect public health. Now enterprises for their own interests, improve the enthusiasm of pollution control, cherish the limited emission rights, reducing the emission of pollutants. Driven by the economic benefits, reducing the emission of pollutants will change from the government's compulsory behavior to the enterprise's conscious market behavior, so as to truly achieve the goal of protecting the environment, protecting nature and protecting public health. Emission right, also known as "emission right", is the right to discharge pollutants, which refers to the right of the emitter to discharge pollutants into the environment within the quota allocated by the government according to law. This right is essentially the right of the polluter to possess, use and benefit from the environmental capacity resources. Next, under the premise that the total amount of pollutants discharged does not exceed the permitted amount, the amount of pollutants discharged is adjusted by means of currency exchange between the internal sources of pollution. Since the emission trading was put forward by American economist Dales in 1968, it has been applied to the management of air and river pollution sources in the United States since the 1970s. China began to carry out pilot projects in 2007, and 14 provinces (autonomous regions and municipalities), including Zhejiang and Jiangsu, have been fully implemented.</div>

The imminent completion of this first trade also marks the official launch of the pilot program for the trading of emission rights in Qingdao. This will also be the first emission rights trade in the Province as well as the first city-level  emission rights trade in the nation. In the morning of the 11th, Zhao Xiuping, general manager of Qingdao Shuangtao Jingxi Chemical Industry (Group) came to the Qingdao City Emissions Trading Center to submit an application to purchase emission rights. This corporation, situated in the factory area of Old Town of Qingdao, stopped its production lines at the end of last year, and was moved, using environment-friendly means, to a new plant area in Pingdu. Zhao Xiuping submitted the application form, environmental impact report, and other materials for the construction project.

Staff will complete checking and ratification within seven working days. The first transaction, which will be completed soon, also marks the formal initiation of the Qingdao Emissions Trading Pilot Project. This will also be the first emissions trading in the province and the first city-level emissions trading in the entire country. Zhao Xiuping said, "Presently, enterprises have invested RMB400 million in environmental protection.

This project is initiated by a mechanical processing company. The company is applying for an initial emissions as chemical oxygen demand (COD) of 0.514 tons/year and ammonia nitrogen (NOX) of 0.052 tons/year. Paying for the use and trading of air pollutant emissions rights is for the city's key power and heat production and supply industrial enterprises. <span class="highlighted">Existing polluting companies that have received a bad rating prior to January 1, 2016 will be temporarily exempt from the usage fee.</span> "Paying for emission rights does not mean gaining the right to generate illegal emissions. The payer may not emit waste as they like." Deputy Director Han Hongyan of the Qingdao Environmental Protection Bureau explained that illegal emissions or emissions that exceed specified limits shall be subject to penalties according to relevant laws. Violating companies will not be able to purchase emission rights to avoid punishments. In another word, we should fight against environmental offense and  excessive discharge by enterprises with serious legal action to protect our environment and public health. Enterprises are now more enthusiastic about pollution treatment because of their own interests; limited emission rights are valued, and emission of pollutants has decreased. Driven by economic interest, reducing emission of pollutants will shift from mandatory acts imposed by the government to conscious corporate market behavior. Thus, the goal of protecting the environment and nature as well as ensuring public health will be achieved. The right to discharge pollutants, or "emission rights", are a right to emit pollutants, i.e., polluters, within a quota allocated by the government, enjoy the right to discharge pollutants into the environment according to the law. This right is in essence, the right polluters have on the ownership, use and profit of existing resources in the environment. In the next step, under the pretext of keeping total emissions within the allowable emission volume, various internal sources of pollution shall use currency exchange to modulate emissions. Emissions trading was first proposed by the US economist Dales in 1968. In the 1970s, the US made use of this to manage sources of atmospheric and river pollution. Pilot programs were initiated since 2007. Currently, the program is being fully implemented at Zhejiang, Jiangsu, and other 14 provinces (in districts and cities).</div>
	<div class="translation" id="69">Qingdao is the 12th and the first pilot city in Shandong Province to utilize a carbon trading scheme. On the 11th, many companies came to the Qingdao's Emission Trading Center to submit their carbon trading application and will pay the permit fees once it is processed. The first trading done represents that the carbon emission trading pilot program has officially started, and will be the first in the province to introduce the emission trading scheme at the city-level. On the morning of the 11th, Zhao Xiuping, the president of Qingdao Shuangtao Jingxi Chemical Industry (Group) Limited Company, came to the Qingdao Emissions Trading Center to submit an application to purchase an emission permit. The same company had a plant in Qingdao's old town but was shut down last year and relocated to Pingdu for environmental concerns. After Zhao Xiuping submitted the construction and environmental assessment permit application, the Qingdao Emissions Trading Center started to do a preliminary review of the submitted application. The estimated initial emission fee is approximately 641,200 yuan according to the collection standards set by Qingdao Pricing Administration. The staff will process and verify it within 7 business days. The first trading done represents that the carbon emission trading pilot program has officially started, and will be the first in the province to introduce the emission trading scheme at the city-level. Zhao Xiuping mentioned that he has invested RMB 400 million on corporate environmental responsibility. Despite being a large amount of money put into this, it greatly impacts the company's philosophy, social responsibility, and also opens up a new level of innovation management. On the same day, Qingdao Sifang Xincheng Zhizhuo Coach Parts Co., Ltd. also came to purchase emission permits for their annual production of 4,200 pieces of high-speed rail and EMU (Electrical Multiple Unit) interior parts. This project was for the machining companies, with initial emission amount of 0.514 ton/yr of COD, and 0.052 ton/yr of NOX on their application. The carbon emission trading is an important business to support electricity and heat for the city. <span class="highlighted">The carbon credits obtained from EIA before January 1, 2016 will not be charged with the usage fee for the time being.</span> "Purchasing an emission permit does not grant permission to freely discharge illegal pollutants." Han Hongyan, the Deputy Director of the Environmental Protection Bureau of Qingdao stated the those who discharge illegal pollutants and excessive pollutants will still be punished according to the regulation; those discharging illegal discharge of pollutants and excessive discharge of pollutants will still have to be punished in accordance with relevant regulations, and companies will not be able to purchase emission permits to avoid punishment for illegal or excessive discharges. Basically, through legal measures and being stringent on environmental violations and to punish companies for excessive discharges, we will be able to protect the environment and the health of the public. Companies have now put their focus on managing emissions for their own benefit and appreciate limiting the emission amount which has lead to a reduction of pollutants being discharged. With the economic benefits being a factor, the government's bold action has lead to company's to react to take action on reducing emissions. This will all lead to protecting the environment, nature, and the health of the public. The right to emit pollutants, also known as “emissions permit”. It refers to the right of emitters to discharge pollutants to the environment within the limits allocated by the government. This type of right limits the footprint of the polluters in the environment and a right to gain revenue. The next step, assuming that the discharged pollutant does not exceed the limit is to control the emission amount  through carbon emission trading. Emissions trading was proposed by American economist John Dales back in 1968. Since the 1970s in the 20th Century, the United States has applied it to control pollution in the atmosphere and river. China has been doing trials since 2007, and has implemented it in 14 provinces (in regions and cities) including Zhejiang and Jiangsu.</div>

	<div class="translation" id="71">On August 11, when the reporter's telephone interview reached Huang Yilin who has returned to her home at Jinyang in Sichuan, she said: "It was an emergency. The only thing I could think of is to rescue people." Huang Yiling is a student of the 2015 cohort of the Landscape Architecture School in the Central South University Forestry and Technology. Huang Yilin who is now studying the professional field of town and country planning wishes to visit Langzhong in Sichuan to learn about architecture in that region, and thus took the entire family to a trip to that location. At about 10 am on August 8, Huang Yilin's father was resting at the hotel, while she and her mother were getting ready to wander about Langzhong Ancient City. After walking for a short distance, they saw a small crowd screaming and yelling, and approached them out of curiosity. Seeing that the "little boy has disappeared and that the little girl is splashing around in the water, with her head bobbing up and down the river water as the water keeps dragging her down", Huang Yilin, who had learned swimming at a young age, jumped into the water to save the child. After jumping into the river, 165-meter tall Huang Yilin realized she could not find the bottom! The water surface which seemed serene previously hid powerful currents underneath. <span class="highlighted">But she did everything she could to swim toward the little girl.</span> Huang Yilin said that the river was muddy and rapid. She was almost spent swimming a distance of less than 5 meters. She used her entire strength to push the little girl to the side of the levee. "The slope is so slipper. I thought I might sink when I run out of power." Huang Yilin therefore cried out to her mother for help. Upon hearing her daughter's cries, Mdm Yin, who was not a good swimmer, decided to go into the water but was stopped by other swimmers. On August 10, after the story of Huang Yilin leaping into the river to save a girl spread, Mdm Yin received plenty of words of comfort and praise from family members and friends, as well as "blame" from many. " I still feel the linger fear! To tell you the truth, my heart was broken when the kid almost fading on the bank cried out for help. Fear still lingered in Mdm Yin's heart. Despite the dangers, Mdm Yin said that she would still support the choice made by her daughter under such circumstances and felt proud for what she did. Huang Yilin seldom took the initiative to go swimming after she learned the skill because she was forced into it. "Who would have thought it would come in handy." According to Huang Yilin's class monitor Chen Yiyang, the class has long regarded Huang Yilin as the "top-scoring student" and knew that she is willing to help others.</div>
	<div class="translation" id="71">On August 11th, when a reporter returned a call to Huang Yilin in Mianyang, Sichuan, she said “The situation was too dire at the time and the only thought I had in my mind was to save people!”. Huang Yilin is a student from Central South University of Forestry and Technology for the class of 2015. Huang Yilin, who was studying urban and rural planning, wanted to visit Sichuan Zhongzhong to learn about the local architectural design, thus travelled together with her family. At around 10:00 on August 8, Huang Yilin’s father was resting at the hotel, while Huang Yilin and her mom went out to walk around Langzhong Ancient City. Without venturing too far, they saw a group of people yelling and screaming thus went up to see what the commotion was about. She saw that "the boy was already out of sight and the girl was desperately trying to stay above water with only half her head visible as her head bobbled up and down in the river". Huang Yilin had learned how to swim when she was young and jumped in quickly to save the child. After diving in, Huang Yilin realized that despite being 165 cm tall, her feet could not touch the bottom of the river!  Although the surface of the river seemed calm, the current was strong underneath!  <span class="highlighted">But she was still determined to swim toward the girl.</span> Huang Yilin said that the river was muddy and turbulent and she had to use almost all her strength to reach the girl who was less than 5 meters away. She tried her best to push the little girl to the edge of the river bank. "The slope was very slippery and I was afraid that I would use up my energy and sink." Huang Yilin called out to her mom for help. Her mom heard her cry for help and was about to go in the water and help. However as her mom was not in proper attire, she was stopped by a tourist beside her. On August 10th, after Huang Yilin jumped in the river to save the child, her mom was bombarded with comments, compliments, and "questions" from friends and relatives. "If you look back at it now, it was really scary! To be honest, when she could barely hold on to the riverbank and called to me for help, my heart almost shattered." Ms. Yin said that despite being dangerous, she would still support her daughter's decision if something like this happened again. She was very proud of her daughter!  Because Huang Yilin was forced to learn swimming, she never really swam after learning how to swim but "never thought it would come in handy in such a situation." According to the introduction of Huang Yilin's class leader Chen Yi-yang, Huang Yi-lin is recognized as an "honor student" and likes to help others.</div>

	<div class="source" id="78">国家发展改革委产业协调司负责人今天在此间指出，钢铁产能过剩是全球性问题。 <span class="highlighted">我国近年产能利用率均高于全球平均水平，也高于美欧等国家和地区。</span> 我国已经采取坚决有效的措施化解过剩产能，而且成效正在逐步显现。 该负责人指出，对钢铁产能过剩这一全球性问题，党中央国务院高度重视。 各部门、各地区积极贯彻落实国务院部署，认真开展工作，今年要压减粗钢产能4500万吨左右。 从我国国情出发，我国并不鼓励钢材出口，相反，还采取一系列切实措施控制钢材出口。 这位负责人强调，钢铁产品国际贸易本质上讲是市场行为，是源于进口国需求、消费者综合考虑产品性价比等因素后的自主选择。 实施贸易保护措施无助于从根本上解决全球钢铁产业的发展问题，相反，只会对国际贸易秩序造成进一步冲击。 在谈到债务时，该负责人强调，化解债务问题是化解过剩产能过程中需要妥善处理好的重要问题。 由于钢铁企业资产规模大，涉及面广，一些企业的债务关系复杂，如果处置不当，有可能引发区域性风险。 据该负责人介绍，近年来，随着经济下行压力加大，社会总需求逐步减弱，部分行业产能利用率下降，企业生产经营困难加大。 一些企业不适应市场环境变化，生产经营难以为继甚至濒临倒闭，但受一些体制机制因素制约，以市场化方式退出的障碍较多，成为“僵尸企业”。 这类企业的存在，扭曲了市场信号，降低了要素资源利用效率，增加了社会管理成本，妨碍了公平竞争市场环境的建立。 导致亏损的主要原因与全球钢铁行业面临的困境一样——市场需求不振、产能利用率低。 我国主要采取市场机制、经济手段和法治办法，政府主要是做好职工兜底和社会稳定工作，保证公平公正的市场秩序。 这位负责人强调，下一步，要坚定不移继续抓好去产能工作，确保完成5年化解粗钢产能1亿~1.5亿吨的目标任务。</div>
	<div class="translation" id="78">The head of the Industrial Coordination Department of the National Development and Reform Commission said here today that steel overcapacity is a global problem. <span class="highlighted">In recent years, China's capacity utilization rate is higher than the global average and higher than the United States and Europe and other countries and regions.</span> China has taken resolute and effective measures to eliminate excess capacity, and the results are gradually emerging. The person in charge pointed out that the party Central Committee and the State Council attach great importance to the global problem of excess steel production capacity. Various departments and regions have actively implemented the State Council's plan and carried out serious work to reduce crude steel production capacity by about 45 million tons this year. Proceeding from China's national conditions, China does not encourage steel exports, on the contrary, it has also taken a series of practical measures to control steel exports. The official stressed that international trade in steel products is essentially a market behavior, is derived from the importing country demand, consumers comprehensive consideration of product value for money and other factors after the independent choice. The implementation of trade protection measures will not help to fundamentally solve the problem of the development of the global steel industry, on the contrary, it will only cause further impact on the international trade order. When talking about debt, the chief stressed that resolving the debt problem is an important issue that needs to be properly handled in the process of resolving excess capacity. Due to the large scale and wide range of assets of steel enterprises, the debt relationship of some enterprises is complex, and it is possible to trigger regional risks if not handled properly. In recent years, as downward pressure on the economy has increased, aggregate demand in society has gradually weakened, capacity utilization rates in some sectors have declined and enterprises have greater difficulties in production and operation, according to the chief. Some enterprises do not adapt to changes in the market environment, production and operation is difficult to sustain or even close down, but subject to some institutional and institutional factors, there are more obstacles to exit in a market-oriented way and become "zombie enterprises." The existence of such enterprises distorts market signals, reduces the efficiency of factor resource utilization, increases the cost of social management and hinders the establishment of a level playing field. The main reasons for the losses are the same as those faced by the global steel industry - weak market demand and low capacity utilisation. Our country mainly adopts the market mechanism, economic means and the method of rule of law, and the government mainly does a good job in the work of the bottom line and social stability of the staff and workers to ensure a fair and just market order. The person in charge stressed that the next step is to continue to work hard to ensure the completion of the five-year target of 100 million to 150 million tons of crude steel production capacity.</div>
	<div class="translation" id="78">The head of the Department of Industry Coordination of the National Development and Reform Commission pointed out today that overcapacity in the steel industry was a global issue. <span class="highlighted">Production capacity utilization in our country is higher than that of the global average, and higher than those in the US and Europe.</span> Our country has taken definite and effective measures to address excess production capacity, and preliminary results are gradually emerging. The person-in-charge pointed out that the State Council of the People's Republic of China has placed great importance upon the global issue of excessive steel and iron production capacity. All departments and regions shall actively implement the plans of State Council, and work conscientiously to reduce crude steel production capacity by about 45 million tonnes this year. From the perspective of domestic national conditions, China does not encourage steel exports. On the contrary, it has adopted a series of practical measures to control steel exports. The person in charge emphasized that the international trade of steel products is essentially market behavior. It is triggered by demand from importing nations, as well as the voluntary choice of consumers after taking into consideration a number of factors such as the products' price-performance ratio. The implementation of protectionist measures will not help to fundamentally resolve the development issues of the global steel industry. Instead, this would only result in a further attack on international trade order. When talking about the debt, the person-in-charge emphasized that the key for resolving the debt issue is to properly take care of excessive production capacity. As steel enterprises have massive assets, and cover a broad spectrum, the debt relationships of some of these enterprises are complicated. If handled inappropriately, regional risk could result. The person in charge described that recent increase in economic pressures have led to weakening of overall demands from the society. Production capacity utilization for a number of industries have decreased, increasing the difficulties for corporate production and operations. Some enterprises were unable to adapt to changes in the market environment. Business operations became unsustainable, and were even on the brink of collapse. Constrained by institutional mechanisms however, there were more hindrances to market-oriented exits, resulting in "zombie enterprises". The existence of such enterprises distorted market signals, lowered the utilization rate of factor resources, increased the cost of public administration, and hindered the building of a fair and competitive market environment. The major reason for the losses is similar to the difficulty confronting the global steel industry - market demand is sluggish and capacity utilization rates are low. Our nation mainly adopts a market mechanism, economic means and the rule of law. The government is primarily focused on carrying out various aspects of worker resettlement and social stability, ensuring fair and just market order. The person in charge emphasized that the next step forward would be to steadfastly continue to eliminate excess production capacity, and to ensure that the goal of removing 100 million to 150 million tonnes of crude steel capacity in five years would be achieved.</div>
	<div class="translation" id="78">Today, the head of the Industry Coordination Department of the National Development and Reform Commission pointed out that the excess capacity of steel is a global issue. <span class="highlighted">In recent years, China's capacity utilization rate has been higher than the global average. It is also higher than the United States and Europe and in other countries.</span> China has taken quick and effective measures to resolve the issue of overproduction, and is gradually coming into effect. The person in charge pointed out that the Central Committee and the State Council excess capacity of steel is a global issue. All departments and regions actively implemented the State Council's orders and actively carried them out. The crude steel production capacity this year should be reduced by around 45 million tons. From a national standpoint, China does not encourage the export of steel products. Instead, it adopts a series of practical measures to control the export of steel products. The person in charge emphasized that international trade of steel products is a market-driven decision made by the needs of the importing country based on the price and other factors. The implementation of trade protection measures will not fundamentally solve the problem of global steel industry development. On the contrary, it will only cause further issues to the international market. The person in charge also emphasized that resolving the deficit issue is important and needs to be resolved properly and concurrently with the issue of excess capacity. As the asset and scope of steel making companies are massive, the debt issue of some companies are complex and there will be a regional risk if it is not handled appropriately. According to the person in charge, in recent years, as the pressure of economic downturn has increased, the total social demand has gradually weakened, and the capacity utilization rate of some industries has declined. As a result, the production and operation of enterprises have become increasingly difficult. Some enterprises are unable adapt to the changes in the market, thus production and management are difficult to sustain and lead to bankruptcy. However, due to the constraints of some institutional mechanisms, there are many obstacles to market-based withdrawal which leads to companies becoming "zombie companies". The existence of such enterprises has distorted market signals, reduced resource utilization efficiency, increased social management costs, and hindered the establishment of a fair market environment. The main cause of losses is the same as the predicament faced by the global steel industry. Basically the market demand is weak and capacity utilization is low. Our country mainly adopts market mechanisms, economic instruments, and regulations. The government mainly does a good job for all employees and provide social stability to ensure a fair market. The person in charge emphasized that in the next step, we must diligently continue to do a good job in the production capacity and ensure that the target of reducing 100 to 150 million tons of crude steel production capacity is completed in five years.</div>

Zhang Donghong, a resident at Dongyuan Village at Xiang'an District in Xiamen, just swapped his old 29-inch television for a large 65-inch set several days ago. This daughter of a common farmer is Zhang Binbin, who just won a silver medal for China in the 50 meter rifle three positions in the Rio Olympics. <span class="highlighted">During the evening of the 11th, Zhang Donghong, his wife, and dozens of other family members and friends stood before this new television and witnessed how his daughter started a miraculous spree that brought her from the brink of being dropped out of the competition to a medal winning score.</span> On the day of the competition, Zhang Binbin had a mid to low ranking at one point, and a spot in the final appeared extremely remote. Parents, family, and friends did not give up, and continued to watch to live stream. When the other athletes completed their firing, Zhang Binbin's rank kept rising until she secured the right to compete in the finals. Everyone at her home exploded in a great cheer. In the finals, Zhang Binbin, who again fell behind in the rankings at one point, became increasingly steady as she fired the last few shots. She finished just 0.2 points behind the champion, clinching the silver medal. Across her 16-year shooting career, Zhang Binbin, who is 27-year old this year, brushed past this hard-won silver medal on several occasions. The mother, Zhang Xiaolong, told the reporter that when everyone was still hesitant, Zhang Binbin found several "young persuaders" from the same village. The "little lobbyists" are the kids from the same family participated the training by recommendation at hat time, including the cousin of Zhang Binbin. Not long after entering the Xiamen team, Zhang Binbin once again actively returned to study at a school in Xiang'an due to family difficulties and other reasons. Zhang Binbin returned to Xiamen Team after being repeatedly persuaded by her first coach Zhang Yajie. After joining the provincial team, Zhang Binbin, who took a long time to advance to the national team, returned home at one point because she saw no hope. This visit included more than just Coach Zhang Yajie. Official leaders and coaches from the Xiamen Shooting Shejian Sports Center and Fujian Provincial Team also came by and successfully persuaded Zhang Binbin to return to the provincial team. Just like the competition yesterday, this daughter of Xiamen persisted and once again turned the tables in her shooting career. "Every coach has different way of picking team members. At the time, I noticed that Binbin has really nice hands, and fell in love with them immediately." Zhang Donghong also recalled that although his daughter's performance was not the best at the group training test, the number of rounds she shot was very stable. This was also a key factor why Zhang Binbin attracted the attention of her coach. During training, the farm girl Zhang Binbin was so committed that she left a lasting impression with Zhang Yajie. He recollected that more than one year after Zhang Binbin joined the Xiamen shooting team, the team conducted a standing posture rifle firing training. Team members were required to stand still for half an hour. Zhang Xiaolong told the reporter that her daughter is a quiet and obedient child and has loved drawing and making her own toys since a young age. "Originally, I stayed at home to tailor some clothes, sewing and mending them as needed. Binbin would sit by the corner, collecting the scrap fabrics to make her own fabric doll." She said that her daughter would often sew and make her own toys. Coupled with the fact that she was good at drawing, she was able to create a lifelike face and clothing for the dolls she made. As an athlete, Zhang Binbin spends little time with family, and could only return home during weekends and public holidays. Usually, they communicate using the telephone. Her parents said that whether when meeting in person or talking on the phone, Zhang Binbin seldom said she found things difficult. More often than not, she would chat about happy things with parents. Since they hardly see their daughter, the parents carefully preserved the artwork that their girl has made as a child and the glories that she had later won. Zhang Xiaolong showed the reporter the cartoon artwork his daughter created. "If she didn't become a archer, she would probably continue to draw." There is a cabinet located at the second floor living room in Zhang Binbin's home that is filled with the plaques, medals, and certificates that she had won. Zhang Donghong displayed the medals and awards neatly, and kept all the certificates in a folder. "These are the honors Binbin has received over the years on the basis of her hard work and dedication. All of us cherish them."</div>

However her parents and close friends did not give up on her as they kept their eyes on the text of the broadcast. Upon seeing other players finishing and where they were ranked, they saw Binbin's name go up the rank and secured a seat in the finals, when the families and friends burst in cheers at home. In the finals, she was on the bottom end of the ranking but her last few shots got more stable and won the silver medal with only 0.2 points behind the champion. For Zhang Binbin who is already 27, it was a hard-fought silver medal in her 16 years of her shooting career. Zhang's mother, Xiaolong told the reporters that when they felt hesitant about her doing this, Zhang Binbin brought a group of "young kids" from the same village to persuade her parents. The "young kids" were from the same village who were also recommended to participate in the training at the same time. Among them was Zhang Binbin's cousin. However, shortly after joining the Xiamen team, Zhang Binbin decided to go back to school in Xiang'an to study due to family hardships. But after the coach Zhang Yajie, kept convincing her, she returned to the Xiamen team again. After being in the provincial team, Zhang Binbin once again failed to get in the national team. As she could not see hope in getting in, she returned home once again. This time, not only coach Zhang, but also the managers and coaches of the Xiamen Shooting and Archery Sports Center and the Fujian provincial team came to her home to persuade Zhang Binbin to return to the provincial team. Like yesterday's game, she persisted and overcame the hurdles in her shooting career. "The way a coach decides who makes the team is different. However for me, I knew she was it when I saw Zhang Binbin's hands." Zhang Donhong also remembered that during the test in the training, despite her scores not being the best, her points were very consistent which was the reason the coaches were fond of Zhang Binbin. In the process of training Zhang Binbin, Zhang Yajie remembered clearly the input provided by this farm girl. He recalls that around 1 year after Zhang Binbin joined the Xiamen Shooting team, the team had a endurance training exercise where they were not allowed to move for half an hour. Zhang Xiaolong told the reporters that her daughter was always a quiet and obedient girl who liked to draw and play with homemade toys when she was small. "When I would sew and repair clothes at home, Binbin would use the scrap pieces and make a doll herself. She said that her daughter would often sew her own toys. As she also liked to draw, the facial expression and the clothes of the dolls she made looked really good. As an athlete, Zhang Binbin saw her family less and less, and would only go back home during the holidays, and usually contacted each other by phone. Her parents said that regardless of being together or on the phone, she would seldom talk about her hardship and would mostly talk about something happy with her parents. As they aren't able to see their daughter often, they make sure to carefully keep the drawings she made when she was little at home. Zhang Xiaolong showed a comic drawn by her daughter to the reporter and said "if she didn't become a shooter, she would have probably continued drawing." In the living room on the second floor of Zhang Binbin's house, there is a cupboard full of medals, and certificates she has won. Zhang Donghong arranged the medals neatly, and the certificates in a folder. “These are the result of Binbin's hard work in these 10 years and so, and are very precious to us."</div>

The social circle of cyberspace has become more and more common. It has not only gradually replaced the traditional means of communication by phone, but is also affecting our social circles. It is quietly changing the social lives of people. The benefits of social networking online are obvious, such as the convenience, and especially cater to the young generation. A survey on college students’ social habits shows that 57% of college students spend more than five hours a day using mobile phones, and it has become inseparable with their daily lives. "The social network has the characteristics of inexpensive, fast, and being able to network with a large crowd, which is in line with the needs of college students today." Expanding the circle of interpersonal relationships, a more equal dialogue, and avoiding social concerns are the main reasons why we love chatting online more. New company staffs likes to communicate with their coworkers online. "As many are not familiar with it, they communicated without borders which built a good relationship among them." People who like to make friends also like to use this. "There was an instance where I had lost contact with someone due to a misunderstanding. However I was able to connect with that person again by conversing in groups." Wu Yan, an IT engineer, is an in-depth social networking enthusiast. Most of his social life happens online, where the number of people online is several times more than those offline. Wu Yan admits that being online is "like being a fish in the water". "You can reply your friends at your own pace. You will be able to express yourself better as you have time to think about what to write." "You can stay behind your online ID and avoid face-to-face conflict; will have the peace of mind to think things out before taking action." <span class="highlighted">"Two different people can come together and communicate at the same level. Thus the social concerns in real life seem to be non-existent online."</span> However, Wu’s friend Xiaopeng thinks that Wu’s life is enclosed and abnormal. Xiaopeng and Wu Yan met in a large group and as they were both active talkers, they quickly became good friends. Xiaopeng felt that Wu Yan and two other people online were bland and did not actively express their opinions. Their replies were often "Oh, ok, really," or "Let me check online."</div>

The influence of social networking is becoming more and more extensive, not only gradually replacing the traditional telephone contact, and even infiltrated into the real life circle offline, quietly changing people's social life.

According to a survey on college students' social habits, 57 percent of college students spend more than five hours a day using their mobile phones. "Social networking has the characteristics of low cost, high transmission speed and multiple people communicating at the same time, which meets the needs of contemporary college students." Expanding the circle of relationships, having more equal conversations, and avoiding social concerns are the main reasons why we love online chatting more and more. Newcomers to the company love to communicate with colleagues online, "because they are not familiar with the unit, through the social platform praise comments, the relationship is much closer than before." Love to make friends is also commonly used online communication, "with friends before because of some misunderstanding did not contact for some time, and later in a large group of first dialogue a few words before they warm up again." Wu Yan, an IT engineer, is a deep social network enthusiast. Most of his social life takes place online, with online contacts several times larger than the number of offline friends. Wu Yan himself also admitted to being more "like a duck to water" on the Internet. "You can reply to a friend when it's convenient for you, because you have a lot of time to think about words and you can express them more clearly." "Hidden under the ID, you and I avoid face-to-face collisions, not only have room to maneuver, and even give each other more time and space to think about words and deeds." <span class="highlighted">"People of different identities have the right and efficiency to speak the same way, and social concerns in real life seem to be dispelled in cyberspace."</span> However, Wu Yan's friend Xiao Peng feels that Wu Yan in life is a "pretty boring house man."

Xiao Peng feels that Wu Yan is different from the Internet, the language is boring, do not take the initiative to express their views, flipping over and over is a few words, "Oh, OK, is it", or "This I want to check on the Internet."</div>

A survey investigating college student socializing habits found that 57% of college students spend more than 5 hours a day on cellphones, literally making cellphones "inseparable" during everyday lives. "The characteristics of social networks include being low-cost, having fast transmission rates, and allowing many people to interact simultaneously. This suits the needs of contemporary university students. Expanded relationship circles, being able to chat on equal footing, and avoidance of social stigma are the main reasons why we become increasingly fond of online chat. The newcomers enjoy online communication with other employees, " because we are not familiar with each other at the beginning. But the 'like' and comment in the social media will close the distance." People who enjoy making friends also used online networking. "I haven't been contacting a friend for a while due to some misunderstanding. We then shared a few words in a larger group and things got better from there." IT engineer Wu Yan is strong fan for social networking, and spends most of his socializing time and life online, with many more online contacts than friends he meet offline. Wu Yan himself honestly said that he feels like "fish returned to the water" when he goes online. "You may reply to a friend when you are willing at a time that is convenient for you to do so because there is plenty of time for you to deliberate the wordings, and you can also express yourself more clearly." "The ID provides one with a cover to avoid all face-to-face interpersonal conflicts, providing one with more room to maneuver and also provided both sides with more time and space to think about what they say." <span class="highlighted">"People of different status are given the same rights to speech and the same voice. Various social taboos in real life seem to disappear in the online world."</span> Xiaopeng, a friend of Wu Yan, felt that the real life Wu Yan is a "boring geek". Xiaopeng and Wu Yan met in a big group. As they were both active speakers, they became acquainted very quickly. Xiaopeng felt that Wu Yan was completely different from his online personality. The real Wu Yan used little words and never gave any opinions. The only phrases he would use were: "Ho ho. Alright. Really?" or "I'll check that online."</div>

	<div class="translation" id="87">Gracia is a budding female toucan with the scent of a tropical rainforest. In the Central American country of Costa Rica, the toucan Gracia and its story have long been a household name. At a press conference on August 10, Gracia, who is recovering from surgery, finally appeared to show off her brand-new, 3D printed plastic beak. The dying toucan, which had its beak snapped off a year and a half ago, has been given a new lease of life. This day heralds not only its 100 per cent return to health, but also its move into the luxurious aviary and its meeting with human friends who care about it. Gracia, who had just entered her new home, was a little shy, but soon became active, wallowing in the basin and eating the grapes with her new beak. To remind people of the damage it has suffered, instead of painting its new beak, technicians have kept the original white of the 3D printing material. The beak is covered with a thin, horny sheath that is hollow inside, with only a few thin, bone-supporting poles interlaced. Despite this internal reinforcement, the toucan's beak is still fragile and will break when it is damaged. The Animal Rescue Center, ornithologists and an American 3D printing company worked together to create several "experimental beaks" for Gracia, finally creating the "perfect beak" for her. Gracia is now adept at using her new beak to drink, eat and even pick up tiny grains. "The final product took about two months to design and only four or five hours to print." "3D printing is not the technology of the future, it has really come into your life and mine," Thomas Langer, chairman of SG3D printing company, told Xinhua International. Gracia, a toucan covered in blood, was discovered on a farm in Gracia, in the central Alajuela province of Costa Rica, in January 2015. At that time, its beak was brutally broken by a group of young people, it was completely unable to eat, life-threatening. The tragedy in Gracia has caused a flurry of calls against animal cruelty in and around Costa Rica after media reports. There have been calls for stricter animal protection laws and greater penalties for abusers. People came spontaneously and did their best to help Gracia get back to life as much as possible before the injury. Even Chuck Hull, the inventor of 3D printing technology, was involved in the design of Gracia's upper beak. "The case of Gracia is unique in that the remaining part of its upper beak is less than one centimetre, which makes it difficult to install a new beak," he said. "We scanned Gracia and then designed and made an extended prosthesis that was slightly longer than the rest of her upper beak. <span class="highlighted">"This will reduce further invasive damage to Gracia," Langer told Xinhua International.</span> Before installing the prosthesis, staff had to clean up Gracia's beak every day to prevent infection. Thousands of miles away, the story of Toucan Gracia moved famous documentary filmmaker Paula Heredia and Discovery News producer John Hoffman. They chronicled the installation of Gracia's new beak and recorded a documentary, "Land of the Toucans," which was shown on Animal Planet this month. The documentary "Land of Toucans" shows how a tiny toucan can make a country change for itself, and how it can involve its citizens in the fight against animal cruelty.</div>
	<div class="translation" id="87">Grecia is an adorable female toucan that exudes a tropical feel. The story of Grecia the toucan has been known early on in the Central American country of Costa Rica. In the press release on August 30th, Grecia who recovered from the surgery showed off her new prosthetic 3D printed beak to the public. The toucan whose beak was hacked off by humans and was dying a year and half ago is now reborn. This day not only confirms that she is 100% healthy, but also is a day when she will be relocated to a luxurious cage and a day for those who care about her to be able to see her. Grecia was a bit shy after moving to her new home but became more lively as she played in the water and ate grapes with her new beak. The engineering specialist did not newly paint the 3D printed beak to serve as a reminder to people of what she went through, thus leaving it in the original white color of the 3D printing material. The outer layer of the beak features a thin wall of keratin, and the inside is generally hollow and is only supported by several thin bone struts. Despite the interior being reinforced, the toucan's beak is still frail and can break when damaged. With the collaboration with the animal rescue center, bird specialists, and a US 3D printing company, the group was able to create several "trial versions" to identify and finally create "the perfect one". Grecia can now skillfully use her new beak to drink water, eat, and even pick up small grains. "The design of the final product took around 2 months and the printing only took 4-5 hours." The president of SG3D Printing, Thomas Lange explained to Xinhua International during an interview that, "3D printing is not a technology of the future but has already stepped in to our lives". In January 2015, a bloodied toucan (Grecia) was found on a farm in Grecia, Alajuela Province located in central Costa Rica. The beak was brutally hacked off by a group of youngsters. She could not eat at all and was in critical condition. After the media covered the story of Grecia's tragic situation, it triggered a wave of opposition on animal cruelty in and outside of Costa Rica. People have since called out for a stricter animal protection law and for harsher penalties for animal abuse. People proactively came together to do their best to help Grecia recover and regain her life before being injured. Chuck Hall who is the inventor of 3D printing was also involved in the design of Grecia's beak. "Grecia's situation was a very special one as there was less than 1 cm of the upper jaw left, which caused many difficulties in attaching the beak." "We first scanned Grecia then designed an extended cap that was a bit longer than the remnant beak, then glued the prosthetic beak". <span class="highlighted">Lange told the reporters of Xinhua International that "By doing so, we can prevent further injury for Grecia".</span> Before installing the prosthetic beak, the staff had to keep Grecia clean everyday to prevent infections. The story of Grecia the toucan travelled the distance and touched John Hoffman who is a producer at Discovery News Channel and Paul Heredia who is a famous documentary director. They filmed bits and pieces of the installation of Grecia's new beak to make a documentary called "Toucan Nation" which was aired on Animal Planet this month. The documentary "Toucan Nation" shows how a small Toucan inspired a nation to make changes and citizens to get involved to stop animal cruelty.</div>
	<div class="translation" id="87">Gracia is a cute female toucan with the scent of the jungle about her. In the Central American country of Costa Rica, the toucan Gracia and its story are extremely well-known. The August 10 press conference finally revealed Gracia after recovering from the operation, displaying its brand new 3D-printed plastic beak. This toucan whose upper beak was broken by someone, and which was on the brink of death, has now finally received a new lease of life. This is the day that the bird has reached 100% recovery and the day when it could be moved to a luxurious bird house and meet its human friends who have been caring for it. Gracia appears to be rather shy after moving to her new home, but quickly revealed her lively side, playing in the pool of water and using her new beak to eat grapes. To remind people of the abuse it once suffered, the technicians did not color its new beak, but kept it white, the original color of the 3D printing material. The external layer of the beak is a thin keratin sheath. The beak is hollow and only reinforced by thin, criss-crossing supporting struts of bone. Although reinforced internally, the toucan's beak is still fragile, and will crack when it is harmed. The animal aid center, an ornithologist, and a 3D printing company from the United States are working together, making several "experimental beaks" for Gracia before creating the "perfect beak" that best suits the bird. Now Gracia has become proficient in using her beak to drink, eat, and even pick up fine seed grains. "The design of the final product took about two months; printing took just four to five hours." "3D printing is not for next generation. It has become part of our life." Thomas Lange, President of SG3D told the  Xinhua News Agency. On January 2015, Gracia the toucan was found, bleeding from its mouth, by a person in a farm at Gracia, Alajuela Province in central Costa Rica. At the time, its upper beak was cruelly broken by a group of youths. It could not eat and was dying. Once reported in mass media, Gracia's sad state initiated a wave of outcry against animal abuse in and outside Costa Rica. The public requested more rigorous animal protection laws to be established, and punishment for abusers to be stepped out. People came forward voluntarily, and did the best they could to help Grecia regain its life prior to the injury. Even Chuck Hull, the inventor of 3D printing technology, also contributed towards the design of Gracia's upper beak. "Gracia's condition is quite unique. Less than 1 cm of its upper beak has remained, making it difficult to install a new beak." "We first scanned Gracia and then designed and manufactured an extended prosthetic that is slightly longer than its remaining upper beak. The prosthetic is then glued to its upper beak." <span class="highlighted">"This will help reduce further invasive injury on Grecia," Lange told a XInhua international news reporter.</span> Prior to installing the prosthetics, workers cleaned the broken beak for Gracia everyday to prevent infections. Thousands of miles away, the story of Gracia the toucan has moved renowned documentary filmmaker Paula Heredia and investigative journalist John Hoffman. Toucan Nation is a documentary that recorded in detail the process of fitting a new beak for Grecia, which was broadcast on Animal Planet this month. The documentary Toucan Nation showed how a small toucan bird could change a country and encourage every citizen to participate in the movement against animal abuse.</div>

Chongqing, on one other hand, receives heat allowances in the form of heat allowances on weekdays. <span class="highlighted">If the temperature is 35°C to 37°C , a rate of not less than 10 yuan per person per day; if it exceeds 37°C, the rate shall not be less than 15 yuan per person per day.</span> Workers working in high temperature environment above 40°C can receive up to 20 yuan per day per month (except for laborers who already receive the heat allowance according to law). According to this standard, Kaizhou, had the most days of high-temperature weather last month, and was able to receive 330 yuan, and Chengkou had the least number of days which equated to 80 yuan. The highest temperature recorded in Puyang did not reach the high temperature standard, so there was no heat allowance. In the past, many would give cold drinks instead of heat allowances. The City Work Safety Administration stated that such practices are not in line with current regulations. The employer may not deduct or reduce the wages of workers due to the stoppage of work due to high temperature and reduce working hours. The Municipal Bureau of Human Resources and Social Affairs stated that when an employee faces a situation where a the work environment is considered high-temperature but does not receive a heat allowance, he or she can seek legal rights through the labor dispute mediation agency where the company is located, or call 12333 to file a complaint. Where a company refuses to issue a heat allowance, the laborer may complain to the appropriate department in human resources and social security at or above the county level where the employment is located. Also, because heat allowances are part of wages and not benefits, they must be included in total wages and deducted from taxes. Therefore, the heat allowance is not part of the minimum wage and must be paid in cash. It cannot be replaced with physical items such as drinks.</div>
	<div class="translation" id="90">According to the Chongqing Meteorological Bureau portal to the high temperature of the counties statistics, in addition to Youyang, the rest of the city can receive different degrees of high temperature allowance. At least 28 provinces across the country have now clarified the criteria for the payment of allowances, although the criteria are not the same in the provinces and municipalities, while Chongqing receives a high-temperature allowance in the form of a high-temperature working day allowance. <span class="highlighted">If the temperature is above 35 ° C and below 37 ° C, the standard is not less than 10 yuan per person per day, and if the temperature is above 37 ° C, the standard is not less than 15 yuan per person per day.</span> High temperature workers above 40 ℃ are entitled to a monthly allowance of up to 20 yuan / day (except for those workers who have already enjoyed the post allowance for high temperature operation in accordance with the law). According to this standard, last month, the highest number of days of hot weather in Kaizhou can receive 330 yuan, the number of days the least Chengkou is 80 yuan, and Youyang the highest temperature due to not meet the high temperature standards, so there is no high temperature allowance. In the past, many units would offset the high temperature allowance with refreshing drinks. The City Safety Supervision Bureau said that this practice was not in line with the current practice. The employing units shall not deduct or reduce the wages of the workers if they stop working or shorten their working hours due to the hot weather. The city's social service bureau said employees who have not received a high temperature allowance for working in high temperatures can fight for their legitimate rights and interests through the labor dispute mediation agency where the business is located, or call 12333 to lodge a complaint. If an employing unit refuses to pay a high-temperature allowance, the worker may file a complaint with the department in charge of human resources and social security at or above the county level in the place where the employee is employed. At the same time, since the high temperature allowance is part of the salary and not a benefit, it is included in the total salary and deducted from the tax. The high temperature allowance is therefore not covered by the minimum wage and must be paid in cash and cannot be substituted in kind, such as beverages.</div>
	<div class="translation" id="90">Statistics on high temperature days of various districts provided on portal website of the Chongqing City Meteorological Administration said that with the exception of Youyang County, every area in the city could receive varying amounts of high temperature subsidies. Currently, at least 28 provinces in the country have clarified their subsidy disbursement criteria, but the disbursement criteria differs among provinces. In Chongqing, high-temperature subsidy is received based on subsidy for high-temperature working days. <span class="highlighted">At temperatures equal or more than 35℃ and less than 37℃, each person shall be given a fee of not less than RMB10 per day. At temperatures higher than 37℃, each person shall be given a fee of not less than RMB15 per day.</span> Workers working at above a temperature of 40℃ can receive a monthly subsidy of up to 20 RMB per day (this does not apply to a worker who is already provided with a high temperature operation subsidy according to law). According to this criteria, Kaizhou, which experienced the most number of high-temperature days last month would receive RMB330, while Chengkou which experienced the least number of days would received RMB80. As the highest temperature in Youyang did not exceed the high temperature benchmark, it did not receive any high-temperature subsidy. In the past, many companies often use cooling and refreshing beverages to offset the high temperature subsidy. The city administration of work safety, however, expressed that this act is not compliant to the current laws. Employers may not deduct or reduce the salary of laborers if work has to be suspended or work time reduced due to high temperatures. The municipal human resources and social security bureau said that workers who worked under high temperatures without receiving high temperature allowance may fight for their legal rights by way of the labor dispute mediation mechanism, or call 12333 to file a complaint. In case employer refuse to pay high-temperature allowance, employee is entitled to complain to the local administrative authority of HR and social security at the county level. Also, since the high temperature subsidy is considered part of the salary and not a benefit, it is included in total salary and subject to the personal income tax. High temperature subsidies are not included considered part of the minimum wage and must be issued in the form of cash. They cannot be replaced in the form of beverages or other tangible items.</div>

	<div class="source" id="93"><span class="highlighted">很多NBA球员都证明了自己的实力。但是有人进步就有人衰落。</span> 无论是因为年龄的增大还是出场时间被限制，每个赛季都有一些球员的表现会出现退步。 当然了，有些“退步”可能仅仅是数据的缩水，这些球员的实力可能并未下降。 即便韦德仍是联盟里最好的得分后卫之一，但是他在公牛的表现应该不会有热火那么好了。 他和隆多组成的后场射程有限，当家球星巴特勒的三分命中率也只有32.8%，这让他们下赛季的进攻会打得很拥挤。 来到了风城，闪电侠势必把球权更多地让给巴特勒和隆多，自己很可能在常规赛选择养生打法。 奥卡福的情况比较尴尬，作为上赛季76人的第一选择，他在新赛季不得不和西蒙斯以及恩比德竞争上场时间和球权。 这一竞争可能不会来的很快，西蒙斯还需要适应NBA赛场，恩比德也要尽快从伤病中完全恢复，但是奥卡福能否在76人的长人阵中有位置还是个问题。 上个赛季，奥卡福32%的得分来自低位进攻，这一比例高于考辛斯、武切维奇和布鲁克·洛佩斯，同时他的使用率也高居联盟前40。 随着西蒙斯已经展现了出色的控球前锋潜质，恩比德也拥有着更适合NBA比赛的身材，奥卡福的地位恐怕很难再那么稳固了。 过去两个赛季，汤普森的使用率已经稳定在了联盟前20，而这也是他生涯最出色的两个赛季。 不过问题是，随着杜兰特的到来，汤普森的使用率一定会下降，这势必将影响他的发挥。 这一影响将不仅是出手次数的影响，汤神的持球进攻在下赛季肯定也会大大减少，这在某些方面也会降低对手对他的防守难度。 杜兰特的到来一定会让勇士队的球员们数据缩水，但这其中缩水最严重的恐怕就是汤普森了。 但这并不意味着汤神的水平退步，这更像是他为球队整体做出了牺牲。 帕克在上个赛季表现得比数据反映的要好些，不仅是因为他的篮下效率来到了生涯最高，他和阿尔德里奇的化学反应也让马刺队受益。 邓肯退役，吉诺比利宣布再战一年，GDP的组合最终也走到了尽头，作为三个人里最年轻的一个，法国跑车的油箱里也没有多少油了。 在得到了第三枚总冠军戒指之后，只有贾巴尔、乔丹和拉塞尔比詹姆斯赢得了更多的常规赛MVP，而乔丹是唯一一个FMVP比詹姆斯多的人。 哦，对了，詹姆斯刚刚为克利夫兰带来了过去52年里第一座职业体育冠军奖杯。 来到了职业生涯第14个赛季的詹姆斯需要更好的保证体力，为季后赛做好准备。 因此，在常规赛里，詹姆斯的数据很可能进一步下滑，他会把更多的重担分给欧文来承担，不过他仍然会轻松地成为联盟前三的球员。</div>
	<div class="translation" id="93"><span class="highlighted">A lot of NBA players have proven themselves, but some have improved and others have declined.</span> Whether it's because of increased age or limited playing time, there are a number of players who have regressed every season. Of course, some of the "regressions" may simply be data shrinkage, and the strength of these players may not have diminished. Even though Wade is still one of the best shooting guards in the league, he probably won't do as well with the Bulls as the Heat. He and Rondo have limited backcourt range and the establishment star Butler is shooting just 32.8 percent from three-point range, making their offense crowded for next season. Coming to Windy City, the Blitzkrieg is bound to cede more of the ball to Butler and Rondo, and he is likely to choose a regimen to play during the regular season. Okafor is in an awkward position, having to compete with Simmons and Embiid for playing time and ball rights in the new season as the first choice for the 76ers last season. The rivalry may not come soon, Simmons will have to adapt to the NBA and Embiid will have to fully recover from the injury as soon as possible, but Okafor's place in the 76ers' lineup remains a question. Okafor scored 32 percent from the low post offense last season, a higher percentage than Cousins, Vucevic and Brooke Lopez, while his usage rates were also high in the league's top 40. With Simmons already showing excellent possession forward potential and Embiid in better shape for NBA games, Okafor's position is likely to be hard to get any more secure. Thompson's usage has stabilized in the league's top 20 over the past two seasons, the best of his career. The problem, though, is that Thompson's usage is bound to decline with Durant's arrival, and that's bound to affect his play. The impact will be not only in terms of the number of shots taken, but the Towns' holding offense will certainly be significantly reduced next season, which in some ways will also make it easier for opponents to defend him. Durant's arrival is sure to shrink the Warriors' player numbers, but it's probably Thompson who has lost the most. But that doesn't mean that Tommy's level has regressed, it's more like he's made sacrifices for the team as a whole. Parker did better last season than the numbers suggest, not only because his basketball efficiency was at its highest in his career, but also because his chemistry with Aldridge benefited the Spurs. Duncan retired, Ginobili announced another year of fighting, and the GDP combination finally came to an end, and as the youngest of the three, the French sports car didn't have much fuel in its tank. After getting their third championship ring, only Abdul-Jabbar, Jordan and Russell won more regular-season MVPs than James, and Jordan was the only one with more than James. Oh, and by the way, James has just brought Cleveland its first Pro Sports Championship trophy in the last 52 years. James, who arrived in his 14th season of his career, needs to be better guaranteed physical strength and ready for the playoffs. As a result, James' numbers are likely to slide further during the regular season, and he'll share more of the burden with Irving, though he'll still be an easy top-three player in the league.</div>
	<div class="translation" id="93"><span class="highlighted">Many NBA players have proven themselves, but progress for some meant regress for others.</span> Due to aging or restrictions on playing time, performance of several players may become worse for each season. Of course, some of this "degeneration" could be attributed to lowered statistics, but the true ability of these players probably stayed the same. Although Wade is still regarded as one of the best shooting guards in the NBA, his performance with the Bulls will unlikely be as good as when he was at Miami Heat. He and Rondo has limited perimeter shot range, and their superstar Butler only has a 32.8% chance of scoring with a three-point shot. Offenses they head for the next season will be extremely crowded. After arriving at the Windy City, Wade "the Lightning" will, where possible, pass the ball to Butler and Rondo while he himself adopts a more wholesome gameplay strategy in conventional games. Okafor's position is quite precarious. As the only option for the 76ers in the last season, he was forced to jostle with Simons and Embiid for play time and ownership of the ball during the new season. This competition may not be imminent. Simmons still has to adapt to the NBA game. Embiid also has to fully recover from his injuries as soon as possible. Whether Okafor will hold a permanent position in the 76ers however, remains questionable. In the previous season, Okafor's 32% scoring rate was attributed to low post offense. This ratio was higher than that of Cousins, Vučević, and Brook Lopez. His usage rate is also amongst the top-40 of the entire NBA. As Simmons has demonstrated great potential as a point forward and Embiid is starting to get a physique more suitable for NBA games, Okafor's position will only become less stable. For the last two seasons, Thompson has been one of the top-20 most commonly fielded players in the NBA. Those were his most impressive two seasons in his entire career. The problem is that with the arrival of Durant, the chance for having Thompson play in the games will definitely drop, further lowering his chances of performing. This not only affected the chances for Thompson to play the game, his field goal attempts will be vastly reduced in the next season, and reduce the challenges faced by his opponents when defending against him. The arrival of Durant will definitely result in a drop in numbers among Warriors' players, but Thompson will probably have the most to lose. This does not mean that Thompson's standards have dropped. In fact, it appears that he's making sacrifices for the sake of the entire team. Parker's performance last season was better than his stats suggested. Not only did Parker achieve his career best in rebound efficiency, his chemistry with Aldridge also benefited the Spurs. Duncan has retired, while Ginóbili announced that he will play for another year. The GDP combination has finally come to an end. As the youngest of the three, there is little gas in the tank of the French sports car. Only Jabbar, Jordan, and Russell won more standard MVP games than James after obtaining their third championship rings. Jordan is the only person with more FMVP than James. O yes, James has just helped deliver the first professional sports championship trophy to Cleveland in 52 years. James, who is in the 14th season of his professional career, needs to better retain his physical strength to prepare well for the playoffs. Therefore, during the regular season, James' stats may well decline further. He will share more of his burden with Owen but he will easily remain one of the top 3 NBA players.</div>
	<div class="translation" id="93"><span class="highlighted">Many NBA players are able to prove their ability to play but there are people who fall off.</span> Whether it is due to age or limited playing time, there are always players who gets worse each season. Of course those deemed to have "gotten worse" may just be due to the limited stats and data, and they may actually not have gotten worse. Despite Dwayne Wade being one of the top shooting guards in the league, he will probably not perform as well with the Bulls than he did back with the Heat. The backcourt range of Wade and Rondo is limited and Butler who is the star player only has a 32.8% 3-point percentage. This will make their offence limited in the next season. In the windy city, the Flash (Wade) needs to give control of the ball more to Butler and Rondo, while he takes a more conservative approach and stay healthy. Okafor's situation is more awkward. Despite being the number one draft for the 76ers last season, he has to compete with Simmons and Embiid for playing time and ball in the upcoming season. Playing for the spot won't be right away as Simmons still needs to get used to the NBA games, and Embiid need to quickly recover from injuries. The issue remains if Okafor will be able to stay in the 76'ers roster in the long run. Last season, Okafor' was scoring 32% from the low post, which is higher than Cousins, Vucevic, and Brook Lopez. He also has a usage rate of 40 in the league. With Simmons already showing excellent potential as a forward, and Embiid having good potential for the NBA, it may be difficult for Okafor to find a stable role. In the past two seasons, Thompson's usage rate has stabilized at the top 20 in the league, and his last two seasons has been the best in his career. However, with Durant joining the team, the issues would be that Thompson's use rate will certainly decline, and is bound to affect his performance. This will impact his shots taken and will surely reduce greatly next season and make the opponent defend him easier. The arrival of Durant will limit the stats of the Warrior's players, and the player that would be the most affected would most likely be Thompson. But this does not mean Thompson's playing ability will get worse. It is more a matter of fact that he will need to make some sacrifice for the team. Parker performed better than the data reflected last season, not only because his efficiency was at the highest level of his career, but his chemistry with Aldridge also benefited the Spurs. With Duncan retiring and Ginobili playing one last season, the era of Ginobili, Duncan and Parker will finally come to an end. As the youngest of the three, there is not much gas left in the tank for the French import. After winning the third championship ring, only Jabbar, Jordan and Russell and James won more regular-season MVPs, and Jordan is the only person with more Finals MVP than James. Oh and James has just brought home Cleveland's first professional sports championship cup in 52 years. In LeBron's 14 season of his career, he will need to maintain his physical condition to prepare for the playoffs. His stats will probably decline in the regular season as give the ball more to Osman. However, he will still easily be the top three players in the league.</div>

The transaction is about to complete the first single also indicates that Qingdao emissions trading pilot work officially kicked off, which will be the province's emissions trading first single and the first nationwide city-level emissions trading. On the morning of November 11, Zhao Xiuping, general manager of Qingdao Shuangtao Fine Chemical Industry (Group) Co., Ltd. came to Qingdao Emission Trading Center to submit the application for emission rights. The enterprise is located in the old city of Qingdao plant at the end of last year to stop production, environmental protection moved to the new plant in Pingdu. After Zhao Xiuping submitted the application form, the environmental impact statement of the construction project and other materials, the Qingdao Municipal Emission Right Reserve and Trading Service Center began the preliminary examination of the application materials. According to Qingdao prices, finance and other departments to determine the collection standards, the current estimated initial sewage right to use about 644.12 million yuan, staff will be completed within seven working days to verify. The transaction is about to complete the first single also indicates that Qingdao emission trading pilot work officially kicked off, will also be the province's emission trading first single and the first national city-level emissions trading. Zhao Xiuping said: At present, enterprises have invested 400 million in environmental protection, a huge amount on the surface, but the concept of business management, social benefits have a great impact on the enterprise innovation and management has also opened up space. On the same day, Qingdao Sifang Xinchengzhizhuo Bus Accessories Co., Ltd. has also come to the annual output of 4,200 high-speed rail and EMU interior accessories projects to purchase emission rights. <span class="highlighted">The project belongs to the mechanical processing enterprises, the application for the initial emission of chemical oxygen demand (COD) 0.514 tons / year, ammonia nitrogen (NOX) 0.052 tons / year.</span> Air pollutant emission rights paid use and trade for the city's electricity, thermal production and supply of key industrial enterprises. Existing units that have obtained an EIA prior to January 1, 2016, will not be charged a toll fee for the time being. "Paid access to emission permits is not the same as access to the power of illegal discharge of pollutants, and can not be arbitrarily discharged pollutants." Han Hongyan, deputy director of Qingdao Municipal Environmental Protection Bureau, said that if illegal discharge, excessive discharge should still be punished in accordance with the relevant regulations, it is impossible to allow illegal enterprises through the purchase of pollution rights to avoid punishment. In other words, through legal means to crack down on environmental violations, and severely punish enterprises for excessive pollution, so as to protect the environment and protect public health. Now enterprises for their own interests, improve the enthusiasm of pollution control, cherish the limited emission rights, reducing the emission of pollutants. Driven by the economic benefits, reducing the emission of pollutants will change from the government's compulsory behavior to the enterprise's conscious market behavior, so as to truly achieve the goal of protecting the environment, protecting nature and protecting public health. Emission right, also known as "emission right", is the right to discharge pollutants, which refers to the right of the emitter to discharge pollutants into the environment within the quota allocated by the government according to law. This right is essentially the right of the polluter to possess, use and benefit from the environmental capacity resources. Next, under the premise that the total amount of pollutants discharged does not exceed the permitted amount, the amount of pollutants discharged is adjusted by means of currency exchange between the internal sources of pollution. Since the emission trading was put forward by American economist Dales in 1968, it has been applied to the management of air and river pollution sources in the United States since the 1970s. China began to carry out pilot projects in 2007, and 14 provinces (autonomous regions and municipalities), including Zhejiang and Jiangsu, have been fully implemented.</div>
	<div class="translation" id="96">Qingdao is the 12th city in the nation and the first in Shandong Province to implement the pilot program for paying for the use and trading of emissions rights. On the 11th, many companies submitted emission rights purchase applications at the Qingdao Emissions Trading Center. Those who successfully applied for the rights will start paying a usage fee. The imminent completion of this first trade also marks the official launch of the pilot program for the trading of emission rights in Qingdao. This will also be the first emission rights trade in the Province as well as the first city-level  emission rights trade in the nation. In the morning of the 11th, Zhao Xiuping, general manager of Qingdao Shuangtao Jingxi Chemical Industry (Group) came to the Qingdao City Emissions Trading Center to submit an application to purchase emission rights. This corporation, situated in the factory area of Old Town of Qingdao, stopped its production lines at the end of last year, and was moved, using environment-friendly means, to a new plant area in Pingdu. Zhao Xiuping submitted the application form, environmental impact report, and other materials for the construction project. The Qingdao City Emissions Reserve and Trading Service Center began preliminary reviews of the application materials. According to the collection criteria determined by Qingdao's pricing, finance and other departments, the  initial usage fee for emissions rights is currently estimated at approximately RMB641,200. Staff will complete checking and ratification within seven working days. The first transaction, which will be completed soon, also marks the formal initiation of the Qingdao Emissions Trading Pilot Project. This will also be the first emissions trading in the province and the first city-level emissions trading in the entire country. Zhao Xiuping said, "Presently, enterprises have invested RMB400 million in environmental protection. On the surface, this seems an enormous amount, but it has a profound impact on both the operational and management philosophy of enterprises as well as social benefit, and has provided room for innovative management by enterprises. On that day, Qingdao Sifang Xincheng Zhizhuo Coach Components Co., Ltd. also came to apply for and purchase emission rights for the project to produce 4,200 pieces of interior accessories and components for high speed train and electric multiple units. <span class="highlighted">This project is initiated by a mechanical processing company. The company is applying for an initial emissions as chemical oxygen demand (COD) of 0.514 tons/year and ammonia nitrogen (NOX) of 0.052 tons/year.</span> Paying for the use and trading of air pollutant emissions rights is for the city's key power and heat production and supply industrial enterprises. Existing polluting companies that have received a bad rating prior to January 1, 2016 will be temporarily exempt from the usage fee. "Paying for emission rights does not mean gaining the right to generate illegal emissions. The payer may not emit waste as they like." Deputy Director Han Hongyan of the Qingdao Environmental Protection Bureau explained that illegal emissions or emissions that exceed specified limits shall be subject to penalties according to relevant laws. Violating companies will not be able to purchase emission rights to avoid punishments. In another word, we should fight against environmental offense and  excessive discharge by enterprises with serious legal action to protect our environment and public health. Enterprises are now more enthusiastic about pollution treatment because of their own interests; limited emission rights are valued, and emission of pollutants has decreased. Driven by economic interest, reducing emission of pollutants will shift from mandatory acts imposed by the government to conscious corporate market behavior. Thus, the goal of protecting the environment and nature as well as ensuring public health will be achieved. The right to discharge pollutants, or "emission rights", are a right to emit pollutants, i.e., polluters, within a quota allocated by the government, enjoy the right to discharge pollutants into the environment according to the law. This right is in essence, the right polluters have on the ownership, use and profit of existing resources in the environment. In the next step, under the pretext of keeping total emissions within the allowable emission volume, various internal sources of pollution shall use currency exchange to modulate emissions. Emissions trading was first proposed by the US economist Dales in 1968. In the 1970s, the US made use of this to manage sources of atmospheric and river pollution. Pilot programs were initiated since 2007. Currently, the program is being fully implemented at Zhejiang, Jiangsu, and other 14 provinces (in districts and cities).</div>

On the 11th, many companies came to the Qingdao's Emission Trading Center to submit their carbon trading application and will pay the permit fees once it is processed. The first trading done represents that the carbon emission trading pilot program has officially started, and will be the first in the province to introduce the emission trading scheme at the city-level. On the morning of the 11th, Zhao Xiuping, the president of Qingdao Shuangtao Jingxi Chemical Industry (Group) Limited Company, came to the Qingdao Emissions Trading Center to submit an application to purchase an emission permit. The same company had a plant in Qingdao's old town but was shut down last year and relocated to Pingdu for environmental concerns. After Zhao Xiuping submitted the construction and environmental assessment permit application, the Qingdao Emissions Trading Center started to do a preliminary review of the submitted application. The estimated initial emission fee is approximately 641,200 yuan according to the collection standards set by Qingdao Pricing Administration. The staff will process and verify it within 7 business days. The first trading done represents that the carbon emission trading pilot program has officially started, and will be the first in the province to introduce the emission trading scheme at the city-level. Zhao Xiuping mentioned that he has invested RMB 400 million on corporate environmental responsibility. Despite being a large amount of money put into this, it greatly impacts the company's philosophy, social responsibility, and also opens up a new level of innovation management. On the same day, Qingdao Sifang Xincheng Zhizhuo Coach Parts Co., Ltd. also came to purchase emission permits for their annual production of 4,200 pieces of high-speed rail and EMU (Electrical Multiple Unit) interior parts. <span class="highlighted">This project was for the machining companies, with initial emission amount of 0.514 ton/yr of COD, and 0.052 ton/yr of NOX on their application.</span> The carbon emission trading is an important business to support electricity and heat for the city. The carbon credits obtained from EIA before January 1, 2016 will not be charged with the usage fee for the time being. "Purchasing an emission permit does not grant permission to freely discharge illegal pollutants." Han Hongyan, the Deputy Director of the Environmental Protection Bureau of Qingdao stated the those who discharge illegal pollutants and excessive pollutants will still be punished according to the regulation; those discharging illegal discharge of pollutants and excessive discharge of pollutants will still have to be punished in accordance with relevant regulations, and companies will not be able to purchase emission permits to avoid punishment for illegal or excessive discharges. Basically, through legal measures and being stringent on environmental violations and to punish companies for excessive discharges, we will be able to protect the environment and the health of the public. Companies have now put their focus on managing emissions for their own benefit and appreciate limiting the emission amount which has lead to a reduction of pollutants being discharged. With the economic benefits being a factor, the government's bold action has lead to company's to react to take action on reducing emissions. This will all lead to protecting the environment, nature, and the health of the public. The right to emit pollutants, also known as “emissions permit”. It refers to the right of emitters to discharge pollutants to the environment within the limits allocated by the government. This type of right limits the footprint of the polluters in the environment and a right to gain revenue. The next step, assuming that the discharged pollutant does not exceed the limit is to control the emission amount  through carbon emission trading. Emissions trading was proposed by American economist John Dales back in 1968. Since the 1970s in the 20th Century, the United States has applied it to control pollution in the atmosphere and river. China has been doing trials since 2007, and has implemented it in 14 provinces (in regions and cities) including Zhejiang and Jiangsu.</div>

The next generation of iPhones is "eye-catching", hot, hot, rich and out of stock... If you want to buy the real thing for the first time, make sure you choose a good channel, say, Suning. This added to the frustration over the new phone, "It lengthens, but it doesn't project a hologram at all! This generation of iPhones sucks." The iPhone 7, like other iPhones, has been accompanied by countless secrets before it was born. Also, multiple sources have claimed that the new iPhone will eliminate the 3.5mm headphone jack and instead use a Bluetooth connection and charging jack, which would give Apple room to add a second speaker. Another piece of evidence to back up the news is that back in 2014 Apple allowed headphone makers to make headphone products that were connected through a charging interface. The news is either true or false, and the answer won't be revealed until Apple's autumn 2016 launch. But that doesn't detract from the industry's bullish outlook for the iPhone 7 - which many believe will most likely be Apple's last major upgrade to the iPhone family. Though the iPhone's market share has fallen, according to data released recently by market research firm IDC. Among them, Goldman Sachs maintained a "buy" rating on Apple's stock, while BMO analysts said the iPhone 7 would reap a historic sales performance. At the same time, Hock Tan, CEO of Broadcom, said it was likely that Apple would increase revenue by more than 20 percent in the future, thanks entirely to the launch of the iPhone 7. Seven percent of respondents said they planned to buy the iPhone 7, compared with just four percent two years ago. It is understood that 20 per cent of the current group of users who hold the iPhone 6 or 6Plus plan to buy the iPhone 7, which is a fairly high percentage. <span class="highlighted">Second, there is expert analysis, most of the fruit powder like to replace their iPhone handsets from generation to generation.</span> About 26 percent of all iPhone users have not changed their phone in two years, or nearly 120 million users have had their iPhone for two years, according to the report. Media captionTaiwan has been hit by several earthquakes during the production of the iPhone 7. "TSMC's production facilities have been damaged beyond imagination and could have an impact on the initial supply of the iPhone 7." Contradictions between supply and demand will affect ordinary users, it is time to choose a good channel, the first time low prices to start the genuine iPhone 7. According to people familiar with the matter, recently, Suning executives have been meeting with Apple frequently in order to prepare an adequate supply. The operator has already negotiated with Suning, and predictably, with the deep cooperation between the two sides, it is bound to bring lower prices and more intimate services to users. "At the lowest price, consumers might be able to buy an iPhone 7 for as little as $7 a day," he said. Sufficient supply and a variety of concessions, so that the purchase of the iPhone 7 is no longer "pressure mountain," and Suning's logistics, is to turn this beautiful into a more intuitive experience. Maybe you'll get a call in the middle of the night saying, "Hello, Suning EasyJet, your iPhone 7 is here."</div>
	<div class="translation" id="97">Although it has yet to be proven, many information sources indicate that Apple will hold its 2016 Fall event in September. iPhone 7 is really on its way. Although Apple did not respond, news concerning the functions and configuration of the iPhone are being released gradually. Pictures of the "actual phone model" have even appeared on the Internet. The new iPhone could be considered a "public phenomenon". It's popular, sleek, and could not be acquired even if you have the money to pay for it. If you want to buy an original product, you must opt for a proper sales channel such as Suning. This heightened the people's sense of disappointment for the new cellphone. "It became longer, but couldn't project holographs! This iPhone release sucks." Like other iPhones, numerous anecdotes and secret information accompanied the iPhone 7 before its debut. Elsewhere, many sources of information also claimed that the 3.5mm headphone jack will be removed from the new iPhone to be replaced by bluetooth connection and the charging interface. This will give Apple room for adding a second speaker. Another piece of corroborative evidence is that as far back as 2014, Apple had already allowed headphone manufacturers to connect headphone products through the charging interface. The answer to such news, whether true or false, will only be revealed by Apple at the 2016 Fall launch event. This did not stop industry insiders from taking a positive view of the prospects of iPhone 7 however. Many believed that iPhone 7 could very well be the last time Apple would significantly upgrade the iPhone series. However, data recently published by IDC, a market intelligence firm, showed the market share of iPhone has decreased slightly. Goldman Sachs has rated Apple shares as something that can be "bought". BMO analysts believe that iPhone7 will establish a historical record in sales performance. Broadcom CEO Hock Tan also expressed that Apple is expected to achieve more than 20% growth in revenue. This figure can be completely attributed to the release of iPhone7. 7% of those interviewed said they intend to buy iPhone 7 compared to a mere 4% who planned to buy iPhone 6 two years ago. From information available, 20% of users currently holding an iPhone6 or 6Plus have plans for purchasing iPhone7. This proportion is quite substantial. <span class="highlighted">Next, experts analyzed that most Apple fans like to replace their iPhone every other generation.</span> Statistics revealed that among iPhone users, approximately 26% of users have not changed their mobile phones in two years, i.e., the iPhones of about 120 million users have been used for two years. Some media reported that Taiwan has been hit by several earthquakes during the iPhone7 production period. "Damages sustained by TSMC production facilities may have went beyond expectations, and that could have influenced initial supply for iPhone7." Supply and demand conflicts will influence normal users. It is time to select a proper channel and acquire an authentic iPhone7 early at a low price. Insider disclosure revealed that the upper management of Suning and Apple has met frequently in recent times for the purpose of preparing enough resources. Service operators have reached an agreement with Suning. It can be expected that with growing partnership between the two, users will be provided with lower prices and more dedicated services. " The lowest price. The customers might' only RMB 7 a day to get a iPhone7". Sufficient supply of goods and a variety of discounts, buyers of iPhone 7 will not be so stressed out, and Suning's logistics department will all the more turn this happiness into a more intuitive experience. Perhaps you will receive a phone call at midnight. "Hello, this is Suning.com. Your iPhone 7 has arrived."</div>
	<div class="translation" id="97">It has not yet been confirmed yet, but many sources have indicated that Apple's 2016 fall conference will be held in September. The iPhone 7 is really going to come out. Although Apple did not comment, information and specification of the new iPhone has been released and there are "actual" photos of the iPhone 7 on the web. The new generation of the iPhone is going to be slick, popular, and limited, thus if you want to be one of the first one to get a hold of it, be sure to know where to buy it from...like Suning. "This has led to further disappointment in the new phone. It is longer but can't even take videos. This generation of iPhone is terrible." Like the other iPhones, iPhone 7 had its share of secrets before being released. In addition, there are multiple sources claiming that the new generation of iPhone will not feature a 3.5mm headphone jack and use Bluetooth connectivity instead and will just have the charging port. This will provide space for Apple to add a second speaker. As evidence to backup this claim, Apple had developed earphones that would connect to the charging port back in 2014. Regardless of whether the rumors are true or not, we will only know for sure when it is announced in Apple's fall 2016 conference. However, this does not prevent the industry from looking at the potential specification of the iPhone 7 - many believe that the iPhone 7 will most likely be Apple's last major upgrade to the iPhone series. IDC, which is a market research institute recently released data that the market share of iPhone has declined. However, Goldman Sachs will maintain the "buy" rating for Apple's stock, and BMO analysts believe that iPhone7 will come together with a historic sales performance. Additionally, Broadcom’s CEO Hock Tan also stated that Apple’s future revenue growth may exceed 20%, all thanks to the launch of the iPhone 7. Seven percent of respondents said they had plans to purchase the iPhone 7, compared to only four percent who planned to purchase the iPhone 6 two years ago. It is understood that 20% of those currently using the iPhone 6 or 6 Plus plan to purchase the iPhone 7, which is a very high percentage. <span class="highlighted">Also, experts analyzed that most of Apple consumers like to replace their iPhones every generation.</span> According to the data, about 26% of all iPhone users have not changed their phones for 2 years. Which means almost 120 million people have used the iPhone for 2 years. Some media claimed that Taiwan faced several earthquakes during the production of iPhone 7 and, “The damage of TSMC's production facilities was bigger than expected and may affect the initial iPhone 7 supply.” The disparity between supply and demand will affect the average customers. It is time to choose a good place to buy an authentic iPhone 7 early at a lower price. According to informed sources, Suning executives met frequently with Apple in order to prepare enough stock. The company is already in discussion with Suning, and will inevitable provide a lower price and better service for consumers through a high-level of cooperation between the two parties. “At the lowest price, consumers may only need to pay 7 yuan a day to purchase the iPhone 7.” Plentiful stock and various services will make purchasing the iPhone less stressful. Through Suning's logistics, will further lead to a heightened buying experience. You may perhaps get a call in the middle of a night which will say "Hi this is Suning.com. Your iPhone 7 is here."</div>

In Chongqing, high-temperature subsidy is received based on subsidy for high-temperature working days. At temperatures equal or more than 35℃ and less than 37℃, each person shall be given a fee of not less than RMB10 per day. At temperatures higher than 37℃, each person shall be given a fee of not less than RMB15 per day. Workers working at above a temperature of 40℃ can receive a monthly subsidy of up to 20 RMB per day (this does not apply to a worker who is already provided with a high temperature operation subsidy according to law). According to this criteria, Kaizhou, which experienced the most number of high-temperature days last month would receive RMB330, while Chengkou which experienced the least number of days would received RMB80. As the highest temperature in Youyang did not exceed the high temperature benchmark, it did not receive any high-temperature subsidy. In the past, many companies often use cooling and refreshing beverages to offset the high temperature subsidy. The city administration of work safety, however, expressed that this act is not compliant to the current laws. Employers may not deduct or reduce the salary of laborers if work has to be suspended or work time reduced due to high temperatures. The municipal human resources and social security bureau said that workers who worked under high temperatures without receiving high temperature allowance may fight for their legal rights by way of the labor dispute mediation mechanism, or call 12333 to file a complaint. In case employer refuse to pay high-temperature allowance, employee is entitled to complain to the local administrative authority of HR and social security at the county level. Also, since the high temperature subsidy is considered part of the salary and not a benefit, it is included in total salary and subject to the personal income tax. High temperature subsidies are not included considered part of the minimum wage and must be issued in the form of cash. They cannot be replaced in the form of beverages or other tangible items.</div>
	<div class="translation" id="103"><span class="highlighted">According to the Chongqing Meteorological Bureau portal to the high temperature of the counties statistics, in addition to Youyang, the rest of the city can receive different degrees of high temperature allowance.</span> At least 28 provinces across the country have now clarified the criteria for the payment of allowances, although the criteria are not the same in the provinces and municipalities, while Chongqing receives a high-temperature allowance in the form of a high-temperature working day allowance. If the temperature is above 35 ° C and below 37 ° C, the standard is not less than 10 yuan per person per day, and if the temperature is above 37 ° C, the standard is not less than 15 yuan per person per day. High temperature workers above 40 ℃ are entitled to a monthly allowance of up to 20 yuan / day (except for those workers who have already enjoyed the post allowance for high temperature operation in accordance with the law). According to this standard, last month, the highest number of days of hot weather in Kaizhou can receive 330 yuan, the number of days the least Chengkou is 80 yuan, and Youyang the highest temperature due to not meet the high temperature standards, so there is no high temperature allowance. In the past, many units would offset the high temperature allowance with refreshing drinks. The City Safety Supervision Bureau said that this practice was not in line with the current practice. The employing units shall not deduct or reduce the wages of the workers if they stop working or shorten their working hours due to the hot weather. The city's social service bureau said employees who have not received a high temperature allowance for working in high temperatures can fight for their legitimate rights and interests through the labor dispute mediation agency where the business is located, or call 12333 to lodge a complaint. If an employing unit refuses to pay a high-temperature allowance, the worker may file a complaint with the department in charge of human resources and social security at or above the county level in the place where the employee is employed. At the same time, since the high temperature allowance is part of the salary and not a benefit, it is included in the total salary and deducted from the tax. The high temperature allowance is therefore not covered by the minimum wage and must be paid in cash and cannot be substituted in kind, such as beverages.</div>
	<div class="translation" id="103"><span class="highlighted">According to statistics of the Chongqing Municipal Meteorological Bureau portal on the high-temperature weather in various districts and counties except Fuyang, the rest of the city may have a deviance on the high temperature.</span> Currently, there are at least 28 provinces in China that have clearly defined the standards for the subsidy. However, the standards issued by provinces and cities are not the same. Chongqing, on one other hand, receives heat allowances in the form of heat allowances on weekdays. If the temperature is 35°C to 37°C , a rate of not less than 10 yuan per person per day; if it exceeds 37°C, the rate shall not be less than 15 yuan per person per day. Workers working in high temperature environment above 40°C can receive up to 20 yuan per day per month (except for laborers who already receive the heat allowance according to law). According to this standard, Kaizhou, had the most days of high-temperature weather last month, and was able to receive 330 yuan, and Chengkou had the least number of days which equated to 80 yuan. The highest temperature recorded in Puyang did not reach the high temperature standard, so there was no heat allowance. In the past, many would give cold drinks instead of heat allowances. The City Work Safety Administration stated that such practices are not in line with current regulations. The employer may not deduct or reduce the wages of workers due to the stoppage of work due to high temperature and reduce working hours. The Municipal Bureau of Human Resources and Social Affairs stated that when an employee faces a situation where a the work environment is considered high-temperature but does not receive a heat allowance, he or she can seek legal rights through the labor dispute mediation agency where the company is located, or call 12333 to file a complaint. Where a company refuses to issue a heat allowance, the laborer may complain to the appropriate department in human resources and social security at or above the county level where the employment is located. Also, because heat allowances are part of wages and not benefits, they must be included in total wages and deducted from taxes. Therefore, the heat allowance is not part of the minimum wage and must be paid in cash. It cannot be replaced with physical items such as drinks.</div>

Zhang Donghong from Dongyuan Village in Xiang'an District of Xiamen just replaced an old 29-inch TV with a 65-inch TV at his home. This average farmer's daughter is Zhang Binbin who won the silver medal in the 50 meter rifle three positions event at the Rio Olympic Games for China on the evening of the 11th. Zhang Donghong and his wife along with a number of friends and family were in front of the new TV on the night of the 11th to witness their daughter make a miraculous comeback from almost being eliminated In the day of the event, Zhang Binbin was at one point in the lower part of the ranking and did not seem she would reach the finals. However her parents and close friends did not give up on her as they kept their eyes on the text of the broadcast. Upon seeing other players finishing and where they were ranked, they saw Binbin's name go up the rank and secured a seat in the finals, when the families and friends burst in cheers at home. In the finals, she was on the bottom end of the ranking but her last few shots got more stable and won the silver medal with only 0.2 points behind the champion. For Zhang Binbin who is already 27, it was a hard-fought silver medal in her 16 years of her shooting career. Zhang's mother, Xiaolong told the reporters that when they felt hesitant about her doing this, Zhang Binbin brought a group of "young kids" from the same village to persuade her parents. The "young kids" were from the same village who were also recommended to participate in the training at the same time. Among them was Zhang Binbin's cousin. <span class="highlighted">However, shortly after joining the Xiamen team, Zhang Binbin decided to go back to school in Xiang'an to study due to family hardships.</span> But after the coach Zhang Yajie, kept convincing her, she returned to the Xiamen team again. After being in the provincial team, Zhang Binbin once again failed to get in the national team. As she could not see hope in getting in, she returned home once again. This time, not only coach Zhang, but also the managers and coaches of the Xiamen Shooting and Archery Sports Center and the Fujian provincial team came to her home to persuade Zhang Binbin to return to the provincial team. Like yesterday's game, she persisted and overcame the hurdles in her shooting career. "The way a coach decides who makes the team is different. However for me, I knew she was it when I saw Zhang Binbin's hands." Zhang Donhong also remembered that during the test in the training, despite her scores not being the best, her points were very consistent which was the reason the coaches were fond of Zhang Binbin. In the process of training Zhang Binbin, Zhang Yajie remembered clearly the input provided by this farm girl. He recalls that around 1 year after Zhang Binbin joined the Xiamen Shooting team, the team had a endurance training exercise where they were not allowed to move for half an hour. Zhang Xiaolong told the reporters that her daughter was always a quiet and obedient girl who liked to draw and play with homemade toys when she was small. "When I would sew and repair clothes at home, Binbin would use the scrap pieces and make a doll herself. She said that her daughter would often sew her own toys. As she also liked to draw, the facial expression and the clothes of the dolls she made looked really good. As an athlete, Zhang Binbin saw her family less and less, and would only go back home during the holidays, and usually contacted each other by phone. Her parents said that regardless of being together or on the phone, she would seldom talk about her hardship and would mostly talk about something happy with her parents. As they aren't able to see their daughter often, they make sure to carefully keep the drawings she made when she was little at home. Zhang Xiaolong showed a comic drawn by her daughter to the reporter and said "if she didn't become a shooter, she would have probably continued drawing." In the living room on the second floor of Zhang Binbin's house, there is a cupboard full of medals, and certificates she has won. Zhang Donghong arranged the medals neatly, and the certificates in a folder. “These are the result of Binbin's hard work in these 10 years and so, and are very precious to us."</div>

	<div class="translation" id="104">Zhang Binbin, a daughter of Xiamen, had "wonderful hand posture" and experienced multiple "reversals" during her career as a shooter. Zhang Donghong, a resident at Dongyuan Village at Xiang'an District in Xiamen, just swapped his old 29-inch television for a large 65-inch set several days ago. This daughter of a common farmer is Zhang Binbin, who just won a silver medal for China in the 50 meter rifle three positions in the Rio Olympics. During the evening of the 11th, Zhang Donghong, his wife, and dozens of other family members and friends stood before this new television and witnessed how his daughter started a miraculous spree that brought her from the brink of being dropped out of the competition to a medal winning score. On the day of the competition, Zhang Binbin had a mid to low ranking at one point, and a spot in the final appeared extremely remote. Parents, family, and friends did not give up, and continued to watch to live stream. When the other athletes completed their firing, Zhang Binbin's rank kept rising until she secured the right to compete in the finals. Everyone at her home exploded in a great cheer. In the finals, Zhang Binbin, who again fell behind in the rankings at one point, became increasingly steady as she fired the last few shots. She finished just 0.2 points behind the champion, clinching the silver medal. Across her 16-year shooting career, Zhang Binbin, who is 27-year old this year, brushed past this hard-won silver medal on several occasions. The mother, Zhang Xiaolong, told the reporter that when everyone was still hesitant, Zhang Binbin found several "young persuaders" from the same village. The "little lobbyists" are the kids from the same family participated the training by recommendation at hat time, including the cousin of Zhang Binbin. <span class="highlighted">Not long after entering the Xiamen team, Zhang Binbin once again actively returned to study at a school in Xiang'an due to family difficulties and other reasons.</span> Zhang Binbin returned to Xiamen Team after being repeatedly persuaded by her first coach Zhang Yajie. After joining the provincial team, Zhang Binbin, who took a long time to advance to the national team, returned home at one point because she saw no hope. This visit included more than just Coach Zhang Yajie. Official leaders and coaches from the Xiamen Shooting Shejian Sports Center and Fujian Provincial Team also came by and successfully persuaded Zhang Binbin to return to the provincial team. Just like the competition yesterday, this daughter of Xiamen persisted and once again turned the tables in her shooting career. "Every coach has different way of picking team members. At the time, I noticed that Binbin has really nice hands, and fell in love with them immediately." Zhang Donghong also recalled that although his daughter's performance was not the best at the group training test, the number of rounds she shot was very stable. This was also a key factor why Zhang Binbin attracted the attention of her coach. During training, the farm girl Zhang Binbin was so committed that she left a lasting impression with Zhang Yajie. He recollected that more than one year after Zhang Binbin joined the Xiamen shooting team, the team conducted a standing posture rifle firing training. Team members were required to stand still for half an hour. Zhang Xiaolong told the reporter that her daughter is a quiet and obedient child and has loved drawing and making her own toys since a young age. "Originally, I stayed at home to tailor some clothes, sewing and mending them as needed. Binbin would sit by the corner, collecting the scrap fabrics to make her own fabric doll." She said that her daughter would often sew and make her own toys. Coupled with the fact that she was good at drawing, she was able to create a lifelike face and clothing for the dolls she made. As an athlete, Zhang Binbin spends little time with family, and could only return home during weekends and public holidays. Usually, they communicate using the telephone. Her parents said that whether when meeting in person or talking on the phone, Zhang Binbin seldom said she found things difficult. More often than not, she would chat about happy things with parents. Since they hardly see their daughter, the parents carefully preserved the artwork that their girl has made as a child and the glories that she had later won. Zhang Xiaolong showed the reporter the cartoon artwork his daughter created. "If she didn't become a archer, she would probably continue to draw." There is a cabinet located at the second floor living room in Zhang Binbin's home that is filled with the plaques, medals, and certificates that she had won. Zhang Donghong displayed the medals and awards neatly, and kept all the certificates in a folder. "These are the honors Binbin has received over the years on the basis of her hard work and dedication. All of us cherish them."</div>

There is also an area serving traditional snacks and where you can experience traditional handcraft workshops that attracts many kids and people from abroad to take a look and experience it for themselves. There was a couple from France that stayed at the event for almost 3 hours and enjoyed the full experience of the mini flower card workshop. "I learned about this special holiday on the internet, so I decided to come take a look and was a really refreshing experience." They said that although France has similar festivals to commemorate ancestors, the atmosphere is very somber. Unlike the ones back home, there is music, food, and traditional craft here to enjoy. <span class="highlighted">She said, “we were able to see an organized and large scaled festival to worship ancestors along with busy financial metropolis of Hong Kong."</span> “This not only reflects the diversity of Chinese culture, but also allows more people to understand these traditional crafts and pass them on to future generations.” Hu Yansong, president of the event, said: “We don’t want to make the Yulan Festival so somber and scary that people won't want to come. Especially the children.” "We hope that through this event, we can convey to the younger generation that the meaning behind the Yulan festival is about filial piety and appreciation." He also stated that there were 24 teams in the "ghost grappling competition" of which we had a team from the community organization, and some schools so that students can participate as well. It is recognized that the Yulan festival was listed as part of "China Intangible Cultural Heritage" 2011.</div>

Huang Yilin who is now studying the professional field of town and country planning wishes to visit Langzhong in Sichuan to learn about architecture in that region, and thus took the entire family to a trip to that location. At about 10 am on August 8, Huang Yilin's father was resting at the hotel, while she and her mother were getting ready to wander about Langzhong Ancient City. After walking for a short distance, they saw a small crowd screaming and yelling, and approached them out of curiosity. Seeing that the "little boy has disappeared and that the little girl is splashing around in the water, with her head bobbing up and down the river water as the water keeps dragging her down", Huang Yilin, who had learned swimming at a young age, jumped into the water to save the child. After jumping into the river, 165-meter tall Huang Yilin realized she could not find the bottom! The water surface which seemed serene previously hid powerful currents underneath. But she did everything she could to swim toward the little girl. Huang Yilin said that the river was muddy and rapid. She was almost spent swimming a distance of less than 5 meters. She used her entire strength to push the little girl to the side of the levee. "The slope is so slipper. I thought I might sink when I run out of power." Huang Yilin therefore cried out to her mother for help. Upon hearing her daughter's cries, Mdm Yin, who was not a good swimmer, decided to go into the water but was stopped by other swimmers. On August 10, after the story of Huang Yilin leaping into the river to save a girl spread, Mdm Yin received plenty of words of comfort and praise from family members and friends, as well as "blame" from many. " I still feel the linger fear! To tell you the truth, my heart was broken when the kid almost fading on the bank cried out for help. Fear still lingered in Mdm Yin's heart. Despite the dangers, Mdm Yin said that she would still support the choice made by her daughter under such circumstances and felt proud for what she did. Huang Yilin seldom took the initiative to go swimming after she learned the skill because she was forced into it. "Who would have thought it would come in handy." According to Huang Yilin's class monitor Chen Yiyang, the class has long regarded Huang Yilin as the "top-scoring student" and knew that she is willing to help others.</div>

Without venturing too far, they saw a group of people yelling and screaming thus went up to see what the commotion was about. She saw that "the boy was already out of sight and the girl was desperately trying to stay above water with only half her head visible as her head bobbled up and down in the river". Huang Yilin had learned how to swim when she was young and jumped in quickly to save the child. After diving in, Huang Yilin realized that despite being 165 cm tall, her feet could not touch the bottom of the river!  Although the surface of the river seemed calm, the current was strong underneath!  But she was still determined to swim toward the girl. Huang Yilin said that the river was muddy and turbulent and she had to use almost all her strength to reach the girl who was less than 5 meters away. She tried her best to push the little girl to the edge of the river bank. "The slope was very slippery and I was afraid that I would use up my energy and sink." Huang Yilin called out to her mom for help. Her mom heard her cry for help and was about to go in the water and help.

"If you look back at it now, it was really scary! To be honest, when she could barely hold on to the riverbank and called to me for help, my heart almost shattered." Ms. Yin said that despite being dangerous, she would still support her daughter's decision if something like this happened again. She was very proud of her daughter!  Because Huang Yilin was forced to learn swimming, she never really swam after learning how to swim but "never thought it would come in handy in such a situation."

On Monday, Qatar's Energy Minister Mohammed Bin Saleh Al-Sada who holds OPEC's rotating presidency said that OPEC will hold an unofficial meeting during the International Energy Foundation conference which will be held between September 26 and 28.

	<div class="translation" id="109">The Young Zhang Binbin from Xiamen: She started her shooting career as she had "Beautiful Hands" and went through various "struggles". Zhang Donghong from Dongyuan Village in Xiang'an District of Xiamen just replaced an old 29-inch TV with a 65-inch TV at his home. This average farmer's daughter is Zhang Binbin who won the silver medal in the 50 meter rifle three positions event at the Rio Olympic Games for China on the evening of the 11th. Zhang Donghong and his wife along with a number of friends and family were in front of the new TV on the night of the 11th to witness their daughter make a miraculous comeback from almost being eliminated In the day of the event, Zhang Binbin was at one point in the lower part of the ranking and did not seem she would reach the finals. However her parents and close friends did not give up on her as they kept their eyes on the text of the broadcast. Upon seeing other players finishing and where they were ranked, they saw Binbin's name go up the rank and secured a seat in the finals, when the families and friends burst in cheers at home. In the finals, she was on the bottom end of the ranking but her last few shots got more stable and won the silver medal with only 0.2 points behind the champion. For Zhang Binbin who is already 27, it was a hard-fought silver medal in her 16 years of her shooting career. Zhang's mother, Xiaolong told the reporters that when they felt hesitant about her doing this, Zhang Binbin brought a group of "young kids" from the same village to persuade her parents. The "young kids" were from the same village who were also recommended to participate in the training at the same time. Among them was Zhang Binbin's cousin. However, shortly after joining the Xiamen team, Zhang Binbin decided to go back to school in Xiang'an to study due to family hardships. But after the coach Zhang Yajie, kept convincing her, she returned to the Xiamen team again. After being in the provincial team, Zhang Binbin once again failed to get in the national team. As she could not see hope in getting in, she returned home once again. This time, not only coach Zhang, but also the managers and coaches of the Xiamen Shooting and Archery Sports Center and the Fujian provincial team came to her home to persuade Zhang Binbin to return to the provincial team. Like yesterday's game, she persisted and overcame the hurdles in her shooting career. "The way a coach decides who makes the team is different. However for me, I knew she was it when I saw Zhang Binbin's hands." Zhang Donhong also remembered that during the test in the training, despite her scores not being the best, her points were very consistent which was the reason the coaches were fond of Zhang Binbin. In the process of training Zhang Binbin, Zhang Yajie remembered clearly the input provided by this farm girl. He recalls that around 1 year after Zhang Binbin joined the Xiamen Shooting team, the team had a endurance training exercise where they were not allowed to move for half an hour. Zhang Xiaolong told the reporters that her daughter was always a quiet and obedient girl who liked to draw and play with homemade toys when she was small. "When I would sew and repair clothes at home, Binbin would use the scrap pieces and make a doll herself. She said that her daughter would often sew her own toys. As she also liked to draw, the facial expression and the clothes of the dolls she made looked really good. As an athlete, Zhang Binbin saw her family less and less, and would only go back home during the holidays, and usually contacted each other by phone. <span class="highlighted">Her parents said that regardless of being together or on the phone, she would seldom talk about her hardship and would mostly talk about something happy with her parents.</span> As they aren't able to see their daughter often, they make sure to carefully keep the drawings she made when she was little at home. Zhang Xiaolong showed a comic drawn by her daughter to the reporter and said "if she didn't become a shooter, she would have probably continued drawing." In the living room on the second floor of Zhang Binbin's house, there is a cupboard full of medals, and certificates she has won. Zhang Donghong arranged the medals neatly, and the certificates in a folder. “These are the result of Binbin's hard work in these 10 years and so, and are very precious to us."</div>

This time, not only coach Zhang Yajie, Xiamen Shooting and Archery Sports Center and Fujian Province team leaders and coaches came to the home, and eventually persuaded Zhang Binbin to return to the provincial team. Just as yesterday's game, the Xiamen girl with the stick to achieve a shooting on the road to a reversal. "Every coach picks his players differently, and I saw that Benny's hands were so beautiful that I fell in love with him." Zhang Donghong also recalled that in the training test, his daughter, although not the best results, but hit the ring number is stable, which is an important reason for Zhang Binbin attracted coaches. In the process of training Zhang Binbin, Zhang Yajie was most impressed by the dedication of the peasant girl. He recalled that more than a year after Zhang Binbin entered the Xiamen Shooting Team, the team carried out a standing practice of raising a gun and asked the team members not to move for half an hour. Zhang Xiaolong told reporters that his daughter has been a quiet and well-behaved children, from an early age like painting and homemade hand-made toys, "Originally I would make clothes at home, sewing, Binbin will pick up some bits and pieces to make their own dolls." She says her daughter often sews her own handmade toys and, with her expertise in painting, makes everything from the doll's features to her clothes and accessories come to life. As an athlete, Zhang Binbin and his family gathered less and more, only the holidays to go home, usually by telephone contact. <span class="highlighted">Parents said, whether it is to meet or call, Zhang Binbin rarely said their hard work, more with their parents to talk about something happy.</span> Usually can not see his daughter, parents at home will be his daughter's childhood paintings as well as the honor of the calendar year are carefully preserved. Zhang showed his daughter's animated cartoon to reporters, "If she hadn't been a shooter, she should have continued to draw." And in the living room on the second floor of Zhang Binbin's home, there is a cupboard full of medals, medals and certificates she has received. Zhang Donghong neatly placed the medals and medals, certificates are unified into the folder preservation, "these are Binbin more than ten years of hard work in exchange for the honor, we all cherish."</div>
	<div class="translation" id="109">Zhang Binbin, a daughter of Xiamen, had "wonderful hand posture" and experienced multiple "reversals" during her career as a shooter. Zhang Donghong, a resident at Dongyuan Village at Xiang'an District in Xiamen, just swapped his old 29-inch television for a large 65-inch set several days ago. This daughter of a common farmer is Zhang Binbin, who just won a silver medal for China in the 50 meter rifle three positions in the Rio Olympics. During the evening of the 11th, Zhang Donghong, his wife, and dozens of other family members and friends stood before this new television and witnessed how his daughter started a miraculous spree that brought her from the brink of being dropped out of the competition to a medal winning score. On the day of the competition, Zhang Binbin had a mid to low ranking at one point, and a spot in the final appeared extremely remote. Parents, family, and friends did not give up, and continued to watch to live stream. When the other athletes completed their firing, Zhang Binbin's rank kept rising until she secured the right to compete in the finals. Everyone at her home exploded in a great cheer. In the finals, Zhang Binbin, who again fell behind in the rankings at one point, became increasingly steady as she fired the last few shots. She finished just 0.2 points behind the champion, clinching the silver medal. Across her 16-year shooting career, Zhang Binbin, who is 27-year old this year, brushed past this hard-won silver medal on several occasions. The mother, Zhang Xiaolong, told the reporter that when everyone was still hesitant, Zhang Binbin found several "young persuaders" from the same village. The "little lobbyists" are the kids from the same family participated the training by recommendation at hat time, including the cousin of Zhang Binbin. Not long after entering the Xiamen team, Zhang Binbin once again actively returned to study at a school in Xiang'an due to family difficulties and other reasons. Zhang Binbin returned to Xiamen Team after being repeatedly persuaded by her first coach Zhang Yajie. After joining the provincial team, Zhang Binbin, who took a long time to advance to the national team, returned home at one point because she saw no hope. This visit included more than just Coach Zhang Yajie. Official leaders and coaches from the Xiamen Shooting Shejian Sports Center and Fujian Provincial Team also came by and successfully persuaded Zhang Binbin to return to the provincial team. Just like the competition yesterday, this daughter of Xiamen persisted and once again turned the tables in her shooting career. "Every coach has different way of picking team members. At the time, I noticed that Binbin has really nice hands, and fell in love with them immediately." Zhang Donghong also recalled that although his daughter's performance was not the best at the group training test, the number of rounds she shot was very stable. This was also a key factor why Zhang Binbin attracted the attention of her coach. During training, the farm girl Zhang Binbin was so committed that she left a lasting impression with Zhang Yajie. He recollected that more than one year after Zhang Binbin joined the Xiamen shooting team, the team conducted a standing posture rifle firing training. Team members were required to stand still for half an hour. Zhang Xiaolong told the reporter that her daughter is a quiet and obedient child and has loved drawing and making her own toys since a young age. "Originally, I stayed at home to tailor some clothes, sewing and mending them as needed. Binbin would sit by the corner, collecting the scrap fabrics to make her own fabric doll." She said that her daughter would often sew and make her own toys. Coupled with the fact that she was good at drawing, she was able to create a lifelike face and clothing for the dolls she made. As an athlete, Zhang Binbin spends little time with family, and could only return home during weekends and public holidays. Usually, they communicate using the telephone. <span class="highlighted">Her parents said that whether when meeting in person or talking on the phone, Zhang Binbin seldom said she found things difficult. More often than not, she would chat about happy things with parents.</span> Since they hardly see their daughter, the parents carefully preserved the artwork that their girl has made as a child and the glories that she had later won. Zhang Xiaolong showed the reporter the cartoon artwork his daughter created. "If she didn't become a archer, she would probably continue to draw." There is a cabinet located at the second floor living room in Zhang Binbin's home that is filled with the plaques, medals, and certificates that she had won. Zhang Donghong displayed the medals and awards neatly, and kept all the certificates in a folder. "These are the honors Binbin has received over the years on the basis of her hard work and dedication. All of us cherish them."</div>

The only thing I could think of is to rescue people." Huang Yiling is a student of the 2015 cohort of the Landscape Architecture School in the Central South University Forestry and Technology. Huang Yilin who is now studying the professional field of town and country planning wishes to visit Langzhong in Sichuan to learn about architecture in that region, and thus took the entire family to a trip to that location. At about 10 am on August 8, Huang Yilin's father was resting at the hotel, while she and her mother were getting ready to wander about Langzhong Ancient City. <span class="highlighted">After walking for a short distance, they saw a small crowd screaming and yelling, and approached them out of curiosity.</span> Seeing that the "little boy has disappeared and that the little girl is splashing around in the water, with her head bobbing up and down the river water as the water keeps dragging her down", Huang Yilin, who had learned swimming at a young age, jumped into the water to save the child. After jumping into the river, 165-meter tall Huang Yilin realized she could not find the bottom! The water surface which seemed serene previously hid powerful currents underneath. But she did everything she could to swim toward the little girl. Huang Yilin said that the river was muddy and rapid. She was almost spent swimming a distance of less than 5 meters. She used her entire strength to push the little girl to the side of the levee. "The slope is so slipper. I thought I might sink when I run out of power." Huang Yilin therefore cried out to her mother for help. Upon hearing her daughter's cries, Mdm Yin, who was not a good swimmer, decided to go into the water but was stopped by other swimmers. On August 10, after the story of Huang Yilin leaping into the river to save a girl spread, Mdm Yin received plenty of words of comfort and praise from family members and friends, as well as "blame" from many. " I still feel the linger fear! To tell you the truth, my heart was broken when the kid almost fading on the bank cried out for help. Fear still lingered in Mdm Yin's heart. Despite the dangers, Mdm Yin said that she would still support the choice made by her daughter under such circumstances and felt proud for what she did. Huang Yilin seldom took the initiative to go swimming after she learned the skill because she was forced into it. "Who would have thought it would come in handy." According to Huang Yilin's class monitor Chen Yiyang, the class has long regarded Huang Yilin as the "top-scoring student" and knew that she is willing to help others.</div>
	<div class="translation" id="110">On August 11th, when a reporter returned a call to Huang Yilin in Mianyang, Sichuan, she said “The situation was too dire at the time and the only thought I had in my mind was to save people!”. Huang Yilin is a student from Central South University of Forestry and Technology for the class of 2015. Huang Yilin, who was studying urban and rural planning, wanted to visit Sichuan Zhongzhong to learn about the local architectural design, thus travelled together with her family.

Huang Yilin had learned how to swim when she was young and jumped in quickly to save the child. After diving in, Huang Yilin realized that despite being 165 cm tall, her feet could not touch the bottom of the river!  Although the surface of the river seemed calm, the current was strong underneath!  But she was still determined to swim toward the girl. Huang Yilin said that the river was muddy and turbulent and she had to use almost all her strength to reach the girl who was less than 5 meters away. She tried her best to push the little girl to the edge of the river bank. "The slope was very slippery and I was afraid that I would use up my energy and sink." Huang Yilin called out to her mom for help. Her mom heard her cry for help and was about to go in the water and help. However as her mom was not in proper attire, she was stopped by a tourist beside her. On August 10th, after Huang Yilin jumped in the river to save the child, her mom was bombarded with comments, compliments, and "questions" from friends and relatives. "If you look back at it now, it was really scary! To be honest, when she could barely hold on to the riverbank and called to me for help, my heart almost shattered." Ms. Yin said that despite being dangerous, she would still support her daughter's decision if something like this happened again. She was very proud of her daughter!  Because Huang Yilin was forced to learn swimming, she never really swam after learning how to swim but "never thought it would come in handy in such a situation."

	<div class="translation" id="111">Today, the head of the Industry Coordination Department of the National Development and Reform Commission pointed out that the excess capacity of steel is a global issue. In recent years, China's capacity utilization rate has been higher than the global average. It is also higher than the United States and Europe and in other countries. China has taken quick and effective measures to resolve the issue of overproduction, and is gradually coming into effect. The person in charge pointed out that the Central Committee and the State Council excess capacity of steel is a global issue. All departments and regions actively implemented the State Council's orders and actively carried them out. The crude steel production capacity this year should be reduced by around 45 million tons. From a national standpoint, China does not encourage the export of steel products. Instead, it adopts a series of practical measures to control the export of steel products. The person in charge emphasized that international trade of steel products is a market-driven decision made by the needs of the importing country based on the price and other factors. The implementation of trade protection measures will not fundamentally solve the problem of global steel industry development. On the contrary, it will only cause further issues to the international market. <span class="highlighted">The person in charge also emphasized that resolving the deficit issue is important and needs to be resolved properly and concurrently with the issue of excess capacity.</span> As the asset and scope of steel making companies are massive, the debt issue of some companies are complex and there will be a regional risk if it is not handled appropriately. According to the person in charge, in recent years, as the pressure of economic downturn has increased, the total social demand has gradually weakened, and the capacity utilization rate of some industries has declined. As a result, the production and operation of enterprises have become increasingly difficult. Some enterprises are unable adapt to the changes in the market, thus production and management are difficult to sustain and lead to bankruptcy. However, due to the constraints of some institutional mechanisms, there are many obstacles to market-based withdrawal which leads to companies becoming "zombie companies". The existence of such enterprises has distorted market signals, reduced resource utilization efficiency, increased social management costs, and hindered the establishment of a fair market environment. The main cause of losses is the same as the predicament faced by the global steel industry. Basically the market demand is weak and capacity utilization is low. Our country mainly adopts market mechanisms, economic instruments, and regulations. The government mainly does a good job for all employees and provide social stability to ensure a fair market. The person in charge emphasized that in the next step, we must diligently continue to do a good job in the production capacity and ensure that the target of reducing 100 to 150 million tons of crude steel production capacity is completed in five years.</div>
	<div class="translation" id="111">The head of the Department of Industry Coordination of the National Development and Reform Commission pointed out today that overcapacity in the steel industry was a global issue. Production capacity utilization in our country is higher than that of the global average, and higher than those in the US and Europe. Our country has taken definite and effective measures to address excess production capacity, and preliminary results are gradually emerging. The person-in-charge pointed out that the State Council of the People's Republic of China has placed great importance upon the global issue of excessive steel and iron production capacity. All departments and regions shall actively implement the plans of State Council, and work conscientiously to reduce crude steel production capacity by about 45 million tonnes this year. From the perspective of domestic national conditions, China does not encourage steel exports. On the contrary, it has adopted a series of practical measures to control steel exports. The person in charge emphasized that the international trade of steel products is essentially market behavior. It is triggered by demand from importing nations, as well as the voluntary choice of consumers after taking into consideration a number of factors such as the products' price-performance ratio. The implementation of protectionist measures will not help to fundamentally resolve the development issues of the global steel industry. Instead, this would only result in a further attack on international trade order. <span class="highlighted">When talking about the debt, the person-in-charge emphasized that the key for resolving the debt issue is to properly take care of excessive production capacity.</span> As steel enterprises have massive assets, and cover a broad spectrum, the debt relationships of some of these enterprises are complicated. If handled inappropriately, regional risk could result. The person in charge described that recent increase in economic pressures have led to weakening of overall demands from the society. Production capacity utilization for a number of industries have decreased, increasing the difficulties for corporate production and operations. Some enterprises were unable to adapt to changes in the market environment. Business operations became unsustainable, and were even on the brink of collapse. Constrained by institutional mechanisms however, there were more hindrances to market-oriented exits, resulting in "zombie enterprises". The existence of such enterprises distorted market signals, lowered the utilization rate of factor resources, increased the cost of public administration, and hindered the building of a fair and competitive market environment. The major reason for the losses is similar to the difficulty confronting the global steel industry - market demand is sluggish and capacity utilization rates are low. Our nation mainly adopts a market mechanism, economic means and the rule of law. The government is primarily focused on carrying out various aspects of worker resettlement and social stability, ensuring fair and just market order. The person in charge emphasized that the next step forward would be to steadfastly continue to eliminate excess production capacity, and to ensure that the goal of removing 100 million to 150 million tonnes of crude steel capacity in five years would be achieved.</div>

	<div class="source" id="112">很多NBA球员都证明了自己的实力。但是有人进步就有人衰落。 无论是因为年龄的增大还是出场时间被限制，每个赛季都有一些球员的表现会出现退步。 当然了，有些“退步”可能仅仅是数据的缩水，这些球员的实力可能并未下降。 即便韦德仍是联盟里最好的得分后卫之一，但是他在公牛的表现应该不会有热火那么好了。 他和隆多组成的后场射程有限，当家球星巴特勒的三分命中率也只有32.8%，这让他们下赛季的进攻会打得很拥挤。 来到了风城，闪电侠势必把球权更多地让给巴特勒和隆多，自己很可能在常规赛选择养生打法。 奥卡福的情况比较尴尬，作为上赛季76人的第一选择，他在新赛季不得不和西蒙斯以及恩比德竞争上场时间和球权。 这一竞争可能不会来的很快，西蒙斯还需要适应NBA赛场，恩比德也要尽快从伤病中完全恢复，但是奥卡福能否在76人的长人阵中有位置还是个问题。 上个赛季，奥卡福32%的得分来自低位进攻，这一比例高于考辛斯、武切维奇和布鲁克·洛佩斯，同时他的使用率也高居联盟前40。 随着西蒙斯已经展现了出色的控球前锋潜质，恩比德也拥有着更适合NBA比赛的身材，奥卡福的地位恐怕很难再那么稳固了。 过去两个赛季，汤普森的使用率已经稳定在了联盟前20，而这也是他生涯最出色的两个赛季。 不过问题是，随着杜兰特的到来，汤普森的使用率一定会下降，这势必将影响他的发挥。 这一影响将不仅是出手次数的影响，汤神的持球进攻在下赛季肯定也会大大减少，这在某些方面也会降低对手对他的防守难度。 杜兰特的到来一定会让勇士队的球员们数据缩水，但这其中缩水最严重的恐怕就是汤普森了。 但这并不意味着汤神的水平退步，这更像是他为球队整体做出了牺牲。 帕克在上个赛季表现得比数据反映的要好些，不仅是因为他的篮下效率来到了生涯最高，他和阿尔德里奇的化学反应也让马刺队受益。 邓肯退役，吉诺比利宣布再战一年，GDP的组合最终也走到了尽头，作为三个人里最年轻的一个，法国跑车的油箱里也没有多少油了。 在得到了第三枚总冠军戒指之后，只有贾巴尔、乔丹和拉塞尔比詹姆斯赢得了更多的常规赛MVP，而乔丹是唯一一个FMVP比詹姆斯多的人。 哦，对了，詹姆斯刚刚为克利夫兰带来了过去52年里第一座职业体育冠军奖杯。 来到了职业生涯第14个赛季的詹姆斯需要更好的保证体力，为季后赛做好准备。 <span class="highlighted">因此，在常规赛里，詹姆斯的数据很可能进一步下滑，他会把更多的重担分给欧文来承担，不过他仍然会轻松地成为联盟前三的球员。</span></div>
	<div class="translation" id="112">Many NBA players have proven themselves, but progress for some meant regress for others. Due to aging or restrictions on playing time, performance of several players may become worse for each season. Of course, some of this "degeneration" could be attributed to lowered statistics, but the true ability of these players probably stayed the same. Although Wade is still regarded as one of the best shooting guards in the NBA, his performance with the Bulls will unlikely be as good as when he was at Miami Heat. He and Rondo has limited perimeter shot range, and their superstar Butler only has a 32.8% chance of scoring with a three-point shot. Offenses they head for the next season will be extremely crowded. After arriving at the Windy City, Wade "the Lightning" will, where possible, pass the ball to Butler and Rondo while he himself adopts a more wholesome gameplay strategy in conventional games. Okafor's position is quite precarious. As the only option for the 76ers in the last season, he was forced to jostle with Simons and Embiid for play time and ownership of the ball during the new season. This competition may not be imminent. Simmons still has to adapt to the NBA game. Embiid also has to fully recover from his injuries as soon as possible. Whether Okafor will hold a permanent position in the 76ers however, remains questionable. In the previous season, Okafor's 32% scoring rate was attributed to low post offense. This ratio was higher than that of Cousins, Vučević, and Brook Lopez. His usage rate is also amongst the top-40 of the entire NBA. As Simmons has demonstrated great potential as a point forward and Embiid is starting to get a physique more suitable for NBA games, Okafor's position will only become less stable. For the last two seasons, Thompson has been one of the top-20 most commonly fielded players in the NBA. Those were his most impressive two seasons in his entire career. The problem is that with the arrival of Durant, the chance for having Thompson play in the games will definitely drop, further lowering his chances of performing. This not only affected the chances for Thompson to play the game, his field goal attempts will be vastly reduced in the next season, and reduce the challenges faced by his opponents when defending against him. The arrival of Durant will definitely result in a drop in numbers among Warriors' players, but Thompson will probably have the most to lose. This does not mean that Thompson's standards have dropped. In fact, it appears that he's making sacrifices for the sake of the entire team. Parker's performance last season was better than his stats suggested. Not only did Parker achieve his career best in rebound efficiency, his chemistry with Aldridge also benefited the Spurs. Duncan has retired, while Ginóbili announced that he will play for another year. The GDP combination has finally come to an end. As the youngest of the three, there is little gas in the tank of the French sports car. Only Jabbar, Jordan, and Russell won more standard MVP games than James after obtaining their third championship rings. Jordan is the only person with more FMVP than James. O yes, James has just helped deliver the first professional sports championship trophy to Cleveland in 52 years. James, who is in the 14th season of his professional career, needs to better retain his physical strength to prepare well for the playoffs. <span class="highlighted">Therefore, during the regular season, James' stats may well decline further. He will share more of his burden with Owen but he will easily remain one of the top 3 NBA players.</span></div>
	<div class="translation" id="112">A lot of NBA players have proven themselves, but some have improved and others have declined. Whether it's because of increased age or limited playing time, there are a number of players who have regressed every season. Of course, some of the "regressions" may simply be data shrinkage, and the strength of these players may not have diminished. Even though Wade is still one of the best shooting guards in the league, he probably won't do as well with the Bulls as the Heat. He and Rondo have limited backcourt range and the establishment star Butler is shooting just 32.8 percent from three-point range, making their offense crowded for next season. Coming to Windy City, the Blitzkrieg is bound to cede more of the ball to Butler and Rondo, and he is likely to choose a regimen to play during the regular season. Okafor is in an awkward position, having to compete with Simmons and Embiid for playing time and ball rights in the new season as the first choice for the 76ers last season. The rivalry may not come soon, Simmons will have to adapt to the NBA and Embiid will have to fully recover from the injury as soon as possible, but Okafor's place in the 76ers' lineup remains a question. Okafor scored 32 percent from the low post offense last season, a higher percentage than Cousins, Vucevic and Brooke Lopez, while his usage rates were also high in the league's top 40. With Simmons already showing excellent possession forward potential and Embiid in better shape for NBA games, Okafor's position is likely to be hard to get any more secure. Thompson's usage has stabilized in the league's top 20 over the past two seasons, the best of his career. The problem, though, is that Thompson's usage is bound to decline with Durant's arrival, and that's bound to affect his play. The impact will be not only in terms of the number of shots taken, but the Towns' holding offense will certainly be significantly reduced next season, which in some ways will also make it easier for opponents to defend him. Durant's arrival is sure to shrink the Warriors' player numbers, but it's probably Thompson who has lost the most. But that doesn't mean that Tommy's level has regressed, it's more like he's made sacrifices for the team as a whole. Parker did better last season than the numbers suggest, not only because his basketball efficiency was at its highest in his career, but also because his chemistry with Aldridge benefited the Spurs. Duncan retired, Ginobili announced another year of fighting, and the GDP combination finally came to an end, and as the youngest of the three, the French sports car didn't have much fuel in its tank. After getting their third championship ring, only Abdul-Jabbar, Jordan and Russell won more regular-season MVPs than James, and Jordan was the only one with more than James. Oh, and by the way, James has just brought Cleveland its first Pro Sports Championship trophy in the last 52 years. James, who arrived in his 14th season of his career, needs to be better guaranteed physical strength and ready for the playoffs. <span class="highlighted">As a result, James' numbers are likely to slide further during the regular season, and he'll share more of the burden with Irving, though he'll still be an easy top-three player in the league.</span></div>
	<div class="translation" id="112">Many NBA players are able to prove their ability to play but there are people who fall off. Whether it is due to age or limited playing time, there are always players who gets worse each season. Of course those deemed to have "gotten worse" may just be due to the limited stats and data, and they may actually not have gotten worse. Despite Dwayne Wade being one of the top shooting guards in the league, he will probably not perform as well with the Bulls than he did back with the Heat. The backcourt range of Wade and Rondo is limited and Butler who is the star player only has a 32.8% 3-point percentage. This will make their offence limited in the next season. In the windy city, the Flash (Wade) needs to give control of the ball more to Butler and Rondo, while he takes a more conservative approach and stay healthy. Okafor's situation is more awkward. Despite being the number one draft for the 76ers last season, he has to compete with Simmons and Embiid for playing time and ball in the upcoming season. Playing for the spot won't be right away as Simmons still needs to get used to the NBA games, and Embiid need to quickly recover from injuries. The issue remains if Okafor will be able to stay in the 76'ers roster in the long run. Last season, Okafor' was scoring 32% from the low post, which is higher than Cousins, Vucevic, and Brook Lopez. He also has a usage rate of 40 in the league. With Simmons already showing excellent potential as a forward, and Embiid having good potential for the NBA, it may be difficult for Okafor to find a stable role. In the past two seasons, Thompson's usage rate has stabilized at the top 20 in the league, and his last two seasons has been the best in his career. However, with Durant joining the team, the issues would be that Thompson's use rate will certainly decline, and is bound to affect his performance. This will impact his shots taken and will surely reduce greatly next season and make the opponent defend him easier. The arrival of Durant will limit the stats of the Warrior's players, and the player that would be the most affected would most likely be Thompson. But this does not mean Thompson's playing ability will get worse. It is more a matter of fact that he will need to make some sacrifice for the team. Parker performed better than the data reflected last season, not only because his efficiency was at the highest level of his career, but his chemistry with Aldridge also benefited the Spurs. With Duncan retiring and Ginobili playing one last season, the era of Ginobili, Duncan and Parker will finally come to an end. As the youngest of the three, there is not much gas left in the tank for the French import. After winning the third championship ring, only Jabbar, Jordan and Russell and James won more regular-season MVPs, and Jordan is the only person with more Finals MVP than James. Oh and James has just brought home Cleveland's first professional sports championship cup in 52 years. In LeBron's 14 season of his career, he will need to maintain his physical condition to prepare for the playoffs. <span class="highlighted">His stats will probably decline in the regular season as give the ball more to Osman. However, he will still easily be the top three players in the league.</span></div>

To become responsible, in addition to caring for the body, providing them with a healthy and spiritual education, the children are taught how to socialize properly, become responsible adults, and gain success. Good family education means that parents must spend time with their children often and provide them with love, patient care, and teach them how to develop well-mannered speech and behavior, allowing children to achieve better learning and improvements to their mental skills. Every saying and act of parents will influence the development of their child. The child will often mimic their parents, just like the traditional saying that goes: "A dragon gives birth to a dragon, a phoenix gives rise to a phoenix. A rat's child will eventually learn to dig holes." The child will take after its parents. Parents must provide a good role model in front of their children, control their words and saying, and develop an excellent character of their own. All this can indirectly help build a positive personality in children and make them more successful.</div>
	<div class="translation" id="117"><span class="highlighted">In the small life came to this world, parents are responsible for this life, this responsibility lies not only in the child's physical health, but also in the spiritual development, that is, education.</span> If you fail in your children's education, then even if you succeed in your career, you can't make up for the lack of life, the failure of your family. When a new life comes, new mothers and fathers need to spend time and energy to look after and educate their children and take responsibility for them. And responsibility, in addition to the physical care and keeping them healthy, also lies in the spiritual education, which is to let children learn how to be a man, how to be an adult, how to be successful. Good family education means that parents need to accompany their children regularly, give them love, patient care, in addition to the need to teach their children to develop civilized behavior, so that children learn better knowledge, enhance intelligence. What parents say and do will affect the growth of their children. They will imitate their parents, which is often referred to as dragon born dragon, phoenix born chicken, mouse's children can make holes, parents what kind of children. Therefore, parents need to set a good example in front of their children, regulate their own words and deeds, develop their own good character, which can indirectly help children to shape a good heart, let him more excellent.</div>
	<div class="translation" id="117"><span class="highlighted">Once a new life is born to this world, the parents shall bear the responsibility for this life. This responsibility is not only the physical well-being, but also mental development which is education.</span> If you succeed in your business but disregard your child's education, it will not be enough to makeup for the failure of your life and family. When a child is born, new fathers and mothers needs to be responsible and spend time to look after and educate the child. Responsibility of a child not only covers the physical well-being but also to educate them and help them develop mentally. Basically, let the child learn how to behave, grow up, and succeed. A good family environment is one where parents will always be with the child, and take care of the child whole-heartedly. Parents also needs to teach their child how to learn and become civilized. A parent's words and actions can affect how the child grows up. As a child would imitate parent's actions, there is a Chinese saying that a dragon will come from a dragon, a phoenix will come from a phoenix, and the child of a mouse will make holes, which basically means the whatever the parents do, the child will do the same. Therefore, parents have to a good role-model for their child. Parent's should strive to improve themselves and be careful of what you say and do as they can all cultivate a child's good character and become a better person.</div>

The same company had a plant in Qingdao's old town but was shut down last year and relocated to Pingdu for environmental concerns. After Zhao Xiuping submitted the construction and environmental assessment permit application, the Qingdao Emissions Trading Center started to do a preliminary review of the submitted application. The estimated initial emission fee is approximately 641,200 yuan according to the collection standards set by Qingdao Pricing Administration. The staff will process and verify it within 7 business days. The first trading done represents that the carbon emission trading pilot program has officially started, and will be the first in the province to introduce the emission trading scheme at the city-level. Zhao Xiuping mentioned that he has invested RMB 400 million on corporate environmental responsibility. Despite being a large amount of money put into this, it greatly impacts the company's philosophy, social responsibility, and also opens up a new level of innovation management. On the same day, Qingdao Sifang Xincheng Zhizhuo Coach Parts Co., Ltd. also came to purchase emission permits for their annual production of 4,200 pieces of high-speed rail and EMU (Electrical Multiple Unit) interior parts. This project was for the machining companies, with initial emission amount of 0.514 ton/yr of COD, and 0.052 ton/yr of NOX on their application. The carbon emission trading is an important business to support electricity and heat for the city.

Companies have now put their focus on managing emissions for their own benefit and appreciate limiting the emission amount which has lead to a reduction of pollutants being discharged. With the economic benefits being a factor, the government's bold action has lead to company's to react to take action on reducing emissions. This will all lead to protecting the environment, nature, and the health of the public. The right to emit pollutants, also known as “emissions permit”. It refers to the right of emitters to discharge pollutants to the environment within the limits allocated by the government. This type of right limits the footprint of the polluters in the environment and a right to gain revenue. The next step, assuming that the discharged pollutant does not exceed the limit is to control the emission amount  through carbon emission trading. Emissions trading was proposed by American economist John Dales back in 1968. Since the 1970s in the 20th Century, the United States has applied it to control pollution in the atmosphere and river. China has been doing trials since 2007, and has implemented it in 14 provinces (in regions and cities) including Zhejiang and Jiangsu.</div>
	<div class="translation" id="119">Qingdao is the 12th city in the nation and the first in Shandong Province to implement the pilot program for paying for the use and trading of emissions rights. On the 11th, many companies submitted emission rights purchase applications at the Qingdao Emissions Trading Center. Those who successfully applied for the rights will start paying a usage fee. The imminent completion of this first trade also marks the official launch of the pilot program for the trading of emission rights in Qingdao. This will also be the first emission rights trade in the Province as well as the first city-level  emission rights trade in the nation. In the morning of the 11th, Zhao Xiuping, general manager of Qingdao Shuangtao Jingxi Chemical Industry (Group) came to the Qingdao City Emissions Trading Center to submit an application to purchase emission rights. This corporation, situated in the factory area of Old Town of Qingdao, stopped its production lines at the end of last year, and was moved, using environment-friendly means, to a new plant area in Pingdu. Zhao Xiuping submitted the application form, environmental impact report, and other materials for the construction project. The Qingdao City Emissions Reserve and Trading Service Center began preliminary reviews of the application materials. According to the collection criteria determined by Qingdao's pricing, finance and other departments, the  initial usage fee for emissions rights is currently estimated at approximately RMB641,200. Staff will complete checking and ratification within seven working days. The first transaction, which will be completed soon, also marks the formal initiation of the Qingdao Emissions Trading Pilot Project. This will also be the first emissions trading in the province and the first city-level emissions trading in the entire country. Zhao Xiuping said, "Presently, enterprises have invested RMB400 million in environmental protection. On the surface, this seems an enormous amount, but it has a profound impact on both the operational and management philosophy of enterprises as well as social benefit, and has provided room for innovative management by enterprises. On that day, Qingdao Sifang Xincheng Zhizhuo Coach Components Co., Ltd. also came to apply for and purchase emission rights for the project to produce 4,200 pieces of interior accessories and components for high speed train and electric multiple units. This project is initiated by a mechanical processing company. The company is applying for an initial emissions as chemical oxygen demand (COD) of 0.514 tons/year and ammonia nitrogen (NOX) of 0.052 tons/year. Paying for the use and trading of air pollutant emissions rights is for the city's key power and heat production and supply industrial enterprises. Existing polluting companies that have received a bad rating prior to January 1, 2016 will be temporarily exempt from the usage fee. "Paying for emission rights does not mean gaining the right to generate illegal emissions. The payer may not emit waste as they like." <span class="highlighted">Deputy Director Han Hongyan of the Qingdao Environmental Protection Bureau explained that illegal emissions or emissions that exceed specified limits shall be subject to penalties according to relevant laws. Violating companies will not be able to purchase emission rights to avoid punishments.</span> In another word, we should fight against environmental offense and  excessive discharge by enterprises with serious legal action to protect our environment and public health. Enterprises are now more enthusiastic about pollution treatment because of their own interests; limited emission rights are valued, and emission of pollutants has decreased. Driven by economic interest, reducing emission of pollutants will shift from mandatory acts imposed by the government to conscious corporate market behavior. Thus, the goal of protecting the environment and nature as well as ensuring public health will be achieved. The right to discharge pollutants, or "emission rights", are a right to emit pollutants, i.e., polluters, within a quota allocated by the government, enjoy the right to discharge pollutants into the environment according to the law. This right is in essence, the right polluters have on the ownership, use and profit of existing resources in the environment. In the next step, under the pretext of keeping total emissions within the allowable emission volume, various internal sources of pollution shall use currency exchange to modulate emissions. Emissions trading was first proposed by the US economist Dales in 1968. In the 1970s, the US made use of this to manage sources of atmospheric and river pollution. Pilot programs were initiated since 2007. Currently, the program is being fully implemented at Zhejiang, Jiangsu, and other 14 provinces (in districts and cities).</div>

With the economic benefits being a factor, the government's bold action has lead to company's to react to take action on reducing emissions. This will all lead to protecting the environment, nature, and the health of the public. The right to emit pollutants, also known as “emissions permit”. It refers to the right of emitters to discharge pollutants to the environment within the limits allocated by the government. <span class="highlighted">This type of right limits the footprint of the polluters in the environment and a right to gain revenue.</span> The next step, assuming that the discharged pollutant does not exceed the limit is to control the emission amount  through carbon emission trading. Emissions trading was proposed by American economist John Dales back in 1968. Since the 1970s in the 20th Century, the United States has applied it to control pollution in the atmosphere and river. China has been doing trials since 2007, and has implemented it in 14 provinces (in regions and cities) including Zhejiang and Jiangsu.</div>
	<div class="translation" id="121">Qingdao is the 12th city in the nation and the first in Shandong Province to implement the pilot program for paying for the use and trading of emissions rights. On the 11th, many companies submitted emission rights purchase applications at the Qingdao Emissions Trading Center. Those who successfully applied for the rights will start paying a usage fee. The imminent completion of this first trade also marks the official launch of the pilot program for the trading of emission rights in Qingdao. This will also be the first emission rights trade in the Province as well as the first city-level  emission rights trade in the nation. In the morning of the 11th, Zhao Xiuping, general manager of Qingdao Shuangtao Jingxi Chemical Industry (Group) came to the Qingdao City Emissions Trading Center to submit an application to purchase emission rights. This corporation, situated in the factory area of Old Town of Qingdao, stopped its production lines at the end of last year, and was moved, using environment-friendly means, to a new plant area in Pingdu. Zhao Xiuping submitted the application form, environmental impact report, and other materials for the construction project. The Qingdao City Emissions Reserve and Trading Service Center began preliminary reviews of the application materials. According to the collection criteria determined by Qingdao's pricing, finance and other departments, the  initial usage fee for emissions rights is currently estimated at approximately RMB641,200. Staff will complete checking and ratification within seven working days. The first transaction, which will be completed soon, also marks the formal initiation of the Qingdao Emissions Trading Pilot Project. This will also be the first emissions trading in the province and the first city-level emissions trading in the entire country. Zhao Xiuping said, "Presently, enterprises have invested RMB400 million in environmental protection. On the surface, this seems an enormous amount, but it has a profound impact on both the operational and management philosophy of enterprises as well as social benefit, and has provided room for innovative management by enterprises. On that day, Qingdao Sifang Xincheng Zhizhuo Coach Components Co., Ltd. also came to apply for and purchase emission rights for the project to produce 4,200 pieces of interior accessories and components for high speed train and electric multiple units. This project is initiated by a mechanical processing company. The company is applying for an initial emissions as chemical oxygen demand (COD) of 0.514 tons/year and ammonia nitrogen (NOX) of 0.052 tons/year. Paying for the use and trading of air pollutant emissions rights is for the city's key power and heat production and supply industrial enterprises. Existing polluting companies that have received a bad rating prior to January 1, 2016 will be temporarily exempt from the usage fee. "Paying for emission rights does not mean gaining the right to generate illegal emissions. The payer may not emit waste as they like." Deputy Director Han Hongyan of the Qingdao Environmental Protection Bureau explained that illegal emissions or emissions that exceed specified limits shall be subject to penalties according to relevant laws. Violating companies will not be able to purchase emission rights to avoid punishments. In another word, we should fight against environmental offense and  excessive discharge by enterprises with serious legal action to protect our environment and public health. Enterprises are now more enthusiastic about pollution treatment because of their own interests; limited emission rights are valued, and emission of pollutants has decreased. Driven by economic interest, reducing emission of pollutants will shift from mandatory acts imposed by the government to conscious corporate market behavior. Thus, the goal of protecting the environment and nature as well as ensuring public health will be achieved. The right to discharge pollutants, or "emission rights", are a right to emit pollutants, i.e., polluters, within a quota allocated by the government, enjoy the right to discharge pollutants into the environment according to the law. <span class="highlighted">This right is in essence, the right polluters have on the ownership, use and profit of existing resources in the environment.</span> In the next step, under the pretext of keeping total emissions within the allowable emission volume, various internal sources of pollution shall use currency exchange to modulate emissions. Emissions trading was first proposed by the US economist Dales in 1968. In the 1970s, the US made use of this to manage sources of atmospheric and river pollution. Pilot programs were initiated since 2007. Currently, the program is being fully implemented at Zhejiang, Jiangsu, and other 14 provinces (in districts and cities).</div>

The scope of influence of online social networking has become increasingly widespread. Not only has it gradually replaced traditional phone communication, it has even permeated actual offline living circles, quietly changing the social activities of the masses. The benefit of online social networking is obvious. It is easy and convenient, and is therefore much preferred by younger demographics. A survey investigating college student socializing habits found that 57% of college students spend more than 5 hours a day on cellphones, literally making cellphones "inseparable" during everyday lives. "The characteristics of social networks include being low-cost, having fast transmission rates, and allowing many people to interact simultaneously. This suits the needs of contemporary university students. Expanded relationship circles, being able to chat on equal footing, and avoidance of social stigma are the main reasons why we become increasingly fond of online chat. The newcomers enjoy online communication with other employees, " because we are not familiar with each other at the beginning. But the 'like' and comment in the social media will close the distance." People who enjoy making friends also used online networking. "I haven't been contacting a friend for a while due to some misunderstanding. We then shared a few words in a larger group and things got better from there." IT engineer Wu Yan is strong fan for social networking, and spends most of his socializing time and life online, with many more online contacts than friends he meet offline. Wu Yan himself honestly said that he feels like "fish returned to the water" when he goes online. "You may reply to a friend when you are willing at a time that is convenient for you to do so because there is plenty of time for you to deliberate the wordings, and you can also express yourself more clearly." "The ID provides one with a cover to avoid all face-to-face interpersonal conflicts, providing one with more room to maneuver and also provided both sides with more time and space to think about what they say." "People of different status are given the same rights to speech and the same voice. Various social taboos in real life seem to disappear in the online world." Xiaopeng, a friend of Wu Yan, felt that the real life Wu Yan is a "boring geek". <span class="highlighted">Xiaopeng and Wu Yan met in a big group. As they were both active speakers, they became acquainted very quickly.</span> Xiaopeng felt that Wu Yan was completely different from his online personality. The real Wu Yan used little words and never gave any opinions. The only phrases he would use were: "Ho ho. Alright. Really?" or "I'll check that online."</div>

According to a survey on college students' social habits, 57 percent of college students spend more than five hours a day using their mobile phones. "Social networking has the characteristics of low cost, high transmission speed and multiple people communicating at the same time, which meets the needs of contemporary college students." Expanding the circle of relationships, having more equal conversations, and avoiding social concerns are the main reasons why we love online chatting more and more. Newcomers to the company love to communicate with colleagues online, "because they are not familiar with the unit, through the social platform praise comments, the relationship is much closer than before." Love to make friends is also commonly used online communication, "with friends before because of some misunderstanding did not contact for some time, and later in a large group of first dialogue a few words before they warm up again." Wu Yan, an IT engineer, is a deep social network enthusiast. Most of his social life takes place online, with online contacts several times larger than the number of offline friends. Wu Yan himself also admitted to being more "like a duck to water" on the Internet. "You can reply to a friend when it's convenient for you, because you have a lot of time to think about words and you can express them more clearly." "Hidden under the ID, you and I avoid face-to-face collisions, not only have room to maneuver, and even give each other more time and space to think about words and deeds." "People of different identities have the right and efficiency to speak the same way, and social concerns in real life seem to be dispelled in cyberspace." However, Wu Yan's friend Xiao Peng feels that Wu Yan in life is a "pretty boring house man." <span class="highlighted">Xiao Peng and Wu Yan met in a large group because they were both active speakers and soon became familiar with each other.</span> Xiao Peng feels that Wu Yan is different from the Internet, the language is boring, do not take the initiative to express their views, flipping over and over is a few words, "Oh, OK, is it", or "This I want to check on the Internet."</div>

	<div class="translation" id="127">According to media reports, due to the previous large-scale influx of capital into Internet medicine, resulting in the current serious problem of product homogenization, the investment boom gradually receded, capital into a wait and see period. According to data from the Centre for Management Research at Ellison Hospital in Hong Kong, a large number of Internet medical companies have died within one year of their establishment, and about 20 per cent of the start-up Internet medical companies have ceased to exist. However, just as most internet healthcare companies struggle to finance rounds A and B, several segment leaders are still gaining traction. It seems that the Internet can not be a medical entrepreneurship "swarm", but to look at the market demand, sink down to do special, do deep. Yuyue made a capital contribution of 12 million yuan, accounting for 40 percent of the registered capital, and Kyushu Tong Instrument Company made a capital contribution of 18 million yuan, accounting for 60 percent of the registered capital. In recent years, with the state's policy support in medical information, electronic, integrated supply chain management system gradually into all levels of hospitals. <span class="highlighted">The cooperation between Yuyue and Kyushu Tong is precisely aimed at the needs of the market, helping hospitals to build advanced supply chain management system, and using this as an opportunity to seek more cooperation.</span> Unlike many internet healthcare companies, iBaby has been focused on the internet obstetrics vertical since its inception, working both as a mother and a doctor. Pregnant mothers are not only entitled to free 24-hour and one-on-one consultation with a doctor in charge, but are also entitled to paid, directed medical consultation. At the doctor's end, iBaby breaks geographical boundaries by organizing experts to give microlectures, such as online lectures, peer-to-peer exchanges, and case discussions, to doctors at the grass-roots level. At present, the doctor side opened three sections, respectively, for doctors to continue education, doctors social and doctors for help. Services include online learning, case discussions, academic exchanges, social networking platforms with hospitals and doctors in departments, legal assistance for doctor-patient relationships or personal life, and support for entrepreneurship. CEO Wang Lei recently said Ali Health was "willing to sink in" to take down health big data, according to media reports. Internet companies, data companies lack professionalism in the same entry on the writing methods are not uniform. Ali's current layout in the field of health care is divided into three sections, namely Ali Health, Tmall Medicine Hall and Alipay Future Hospital. "It's not just a matter of how much money you have," Wang admits. "It's a matter of getting down and being able to live with the loneliness and do it slowly."</div>
	<div class="translation" id="127">Media revealed that the deluge of capital that swamped online health care resulted in the severe product homogeneity problem we see today. The investment boom is waning gradually. Capital has entered a wait-and-see period. Figures from Hong Kong Ailibi Hospital Management Research Center revealed that many online health care companies close down within the first year of incorporation; approximately 20% of newly founded online health care enterprises no longer exist. However, while most Internet health care companies were struggling to choose between Series A or Series B financing, a number of leading companies in specialized sectors were still able to attract capital. It seems that "rushing headlong" into the Industry healthcare sector is not the wisest option. One must accurately assess market requirements, be patient, and improve the professionalism and depth of services provided. Yuyue contributed 12.0000 million dollars, comprising 40% of the registered capital, while Jointown Pharmaceutical provided 18.0000 million dollars for 60% of the registered capital. In recent years, thanks to national policy support in terms of medical informatization, electronic and integrated supply chain management systems have been gradually introduced into different classes of hospitals. <span class="highlighted">The partnership between Yuyue and Jointown Pharmaceutical aims at meeting market demands and helping hospital establish an advanced supply chain management system. The partnership is also an opportunity to seek additional partnerships.</span> Unlike many Internet health care companies obsessed with scale and extensive coverage, iBaby focused on the vertical industry of obstetrics from the very beginning, channeling their efforts toward supporting both pregnant mothers and their physicians. Pregnant mothers can receive 24-hours one-on-one consultation with a specialist physician for free. They can also pay for personal consultation with a specified physician. At the doctors' end, iBaby has broken down regional restrictions by way of organizing experts to carry out webinars, peer exchanges, case discussions and other mini-seminars. Currently, three segments have been set up at the doctor's end, namely, continuing education for doctors, social networking for doctors, and help for doctors. The contents provided include online learning, medical case studies, and academic exchange; social networking platform between physicians of the same hospital or same departments; and doctor-patient relationships or legal assistance necessary for personal lifestyles, entrepreneurship support, and other services. Media report that CEO Wang Lei expressed that Alibaba Health is "willing to settle down" and takeover the Big Data analytics for health. Online businesses and data companies lack professionalism, and were unable to achieve uniformity in the terminologies of identical keywords. Alibaba has structured its presence in the health care industry into three segments, namely Alibaba Health, Tmall Pharmacy, and Alipay's Future Hospital. Wang Lei disclosed that starting a medical healthcare company is more challenging when compared to other sectors. "This is not just about making money. You must be patient and get used to loneliness to do this properly."</div>
	<div class="translation" id="127">According to media reports, due to the large surge of capital into IOMT (internet of medical things), which resulted in a serious issue of product consistency. With the investment boom slowing down, investments have entered a wait-and-see period. According to data from the Hong Kong Alec Hospital Management Research Center, a large number of venture IOMT companies have gone out of business within a year of starting, and about 20% of them have disappeared. However, just as most of the IOMT companies struggled in the A or B round of financing, there were several leading companies in the niche areas who were still able to obtain sufficient capital. From this observation, one can say that these IOMT cannot "simply all come about doing the same thing", but to watch the market demand and do their due diligence. Jiangsu Yuyue Mdcl Eqpmnt & Spply Co Ltd. invested 120 million yuan, accounting for 40% of the registered capital, and Jiuzhou Tongji Machinery Co., Ltd. invested 180 million yuan, accounting for 60% of the registered capital. In recent years, the digitalized and integrated supply chain management system is slowly being utilized in various levels of hospitals thanks to country's support in the form of policies on the information of IOMT. <span class="highlighted">The cooperation between Jiangsu Yuyue Mdcl Eqpmnt & Spply Co Ltd. and Jiuzhou Tongji Machinery Co., Ltd. targets the market demands, supports hospitals implement advanced supply chain management systems and use this as an opportunity to seek further collaboration.</span> Unlike many IOMT companies, iBaby has been focusing on the vertical field of obstetrics for the Internet from the very beginning and has been working with both mothers and doctors. "On a 24-hour basis, pregnant mothers can not only receive free one-on-one consultations with qualified doctors, and also receive paid medical diagnosis." From the doctor's side, iBaby allows them to provide lectures, communicate better with peers, discuss cases beyond the geographic barriers. Currently, the doctors can set up three sections for doctors to continue their education, communicate with other doctors, and request help from doctors. This provides business support for online learning, case discussions, academic exchanges; social networking with hospitals and doctors in the same department, and necessary legal support relating to doctor-patient relationship. According to media reports, CEO Wang Lei recently stated that AliHealth "has decided" to compile the healthcare data. Tech companies and data companies lack professionalism and cannot cooperate. Alibaba's current presence in the healthcare industry is divided into three sections: AliHealth, Tmall Online Pharmacy, and Alipay's "Future Hospital" program. Wang Lei admitted that business in the healthcare is more difficult than other industries. “It is not simply having enough money, but to be able to persevere and work step by step."</div>

Although Apple did not respond, news concerning the functions and configuration of the iPhone are being released gradually. Pictures of the "actual phone model" have even appeared on the Internet. The new iPhone could be considered a "public phenomenon". It's popular, sleek, and could not be acquired even if you have the money to pay for it. If you want to buy an original product, you must opt for a proper sales channel such as Suning. This heightened the people's sense of disappointment for the new cellphone. "It became longer, but couldn't project holographs! This iPhone release sucks." Like other iPhones, numerous anecdotes and secret information accompanied the iPhone 7 before its debut. Elsewhere, many sources of information also claimed that the 3.5mm headphone jack will be removed from the new iPhone to be replaced by bluetooth connection and the charging interface. This will give Apple room for adding a second speaker. Another piece of corroborative evidence is that as far back as 2014, Apple had already allowed headphone manufacturers to connect headphone products through the charging interface. The answer to such news, whether true or false, will only be revealed by Apple at the 2016 Fall launch event. This did not stop industry insiders from taking a positive view of the prospects of iPhone 7 however. Many believed that iPhone 7 could very well be the last time Apple would significantly upgrade the iPhone series. However, data recently published by IDC, a market intelligence firm, showed the market share of iPhone has decreased slightly. Goldman Sachs has rated Apple shares as something that can be "bought". BMO analysts believe that iPhone7 will establish a historical record in sales performance. Broadcom CEO Hock Tan also expressed that Apple is expected to achieve more than 20% growth in revenue. This figure can be completely attributed to the release of iPhone7. 7% of those interviewed said they intend to buy iPhone 7 compared to a mere 4% who planned to buy iPhone 6 two years ago. From information available, 20% of users currently holding an iPhone6 or 6Plus have plans for purchasing iPhone7. This proportion is quite substantial. Next, experts analyzed that most Apple fans like to replace their iPhone every other generation. Statistics revealed that among iPhone users, approximately 26% of users have not changed their mobile phones in two years, i.e., the iPhones of about 120 million users have been used for two years. Some media reported that Taiwan has been hit by several earthquakes during the iPhone7 production period. "Damages sustained by TSMC production facilities may have went beyond expectations, and that could have influenced initial supply for iPhone7." Supply and demand conflicts will influence normal users. It is time to select a proper channel and acquire an authentic iPhone7 early at a low price. Insider disclosure revealed that the upper management of Suning and Apple has met frequently in recent times for the purpose of preparing enough resources. Service operators have reached an agreement with Suning. It can be expected that with growing partnership between the two, users will be provided with lower prices and more dedicated services. <span class="highlighted">" The lowest price. The customers might' only RMB 7 a day to get a iPhone7".</span> Sufficient supply of goods and a variety of discounts, buyers of iPhone 7 will not be so stressed out, and Suning's logistics department will all the more turn this happiness into a more intuitive experience. Perhaps you will receive a phone call at midnight. "Hello, this is Suning.com. Your iPhone 7 has arrived."</div>
	<div class="translation" id="130">It has not yet been confirmed yet, but many sources have indicated that Apple's 2016 fall conference will be held in September. The iPhone 7 is really going to come out. Although Apple did not comment, information and specification of the new iPhone has been released and there are "actual" photos of the iPhone 7 on the web. The new generation of the iPhone is going to be slick, popular, and limited, thus if you want to be one of the first one to get a hold of it, be sure to know where to buy it from...like Suning. "This has led to further disappointment in the new phone. It is longer but can't even take videos. This generation of iPhone is terrible." Like the other iPhones, iPhone 7 had its share of secrets before being released. In addition, there are multiple sources claiming that the new generation of iPhone will not feature a 3.5mm headphone jack and use Bluetooth connectivity instead and will just have the charging port. This will provide space for Apple to add a second speaker. As evidence to backup this claim, Apple had developed earphones that would connect to the charging port back in 2014. Regardless of whether the rumors are true or not, we will only know for sure when it is announced in Apple's fall 2016 conference. However, this does not prevent the industry from looking at the potential specification of the iPhone 7 - many believe that the iPhone 7 will most likely be Apple's last major upgrade to the iPhone series. IDC, which is a market research institute recently released data that the market share of iPhone has declined. However, Goldman Sachs will maintain the "buy" rating for Apple's stock, and BMO analysts believe that iPhone7 will come together with a historic sales performance. Additionally, Broadcom’s CEO Hock Tan also stated that Apple’s future revenue growth may exceed 20%, all thanks to the launch of the iPhone 7. Seven percent of respondents said they had plans to purchase the iPhone 7, compared to only four percent who planned to purchase the iPhone 6 two years ago. It is understood that 20% of those currently using the iPhone 6 or 6 Plus plan to purchase the iPhone 7, which is a very high percentage. Also, experts analyzed that most of Apple consumers like to replace their iPhones every generation. According to the data, about 26% of all iPhone users have not changed their phones for 2 years. Which means almost 120 million people have used the iPhone for 2 years. Some media claimed that Taiwan faced several earthquakes during the production of iPhone 7 and, “The damage of TSMC's production facilities was bigger than expected and may affect the initial iPhone 7 supply.” The disparity between supply and demand will affect the average customers. It is time to choose a good place to buy an authentic iPhone 7 early at a lower price. According to informed sources, Suning executives met frequently with Apple in order to prepare enough stock. The company is already in discussion with Suning, and will inevitable provide a lower price and better service for consumers through a high-level of cooperation between the two parties. <span class="highlighted">“At the lowest price, consumers may only need to pay 7 yuan a day to purchase the iPhone 7.”</span> Plentiful stock and various services will make purchasing the iPhone less stressful. Through Suning's logistics, will further lead to a heightened buying experience. You may perhaps get a call in the middle of a night which will say "Hi this is Suning.com. Your iPhone 7 is here."</div>
	<div class="translation" id="130">Although it hasn't been confirmed, numerous sources have said Apple's fall 2016 launch will take place in September, and the iPhone 7 is really coming. Apple didn't respond, but word has spread about the new iPhone's features and configuration, and even pictures of the iPhone 7's "real model" are available online. The next generation of iPhones is "eye-catching", hot, hot, rich and out of stock... If you want to buy the real thing for the first time, make sure you choose a good channel, say, Suning. This added to the frustration over the new phone, "It lengthens, but it doesn't project a hologram at all! This generation of iPhones sucks." The iPhone 7, like other iPhones, has been accompanied by countless secrets before it was born. Also, multiple sources have claimed that the new iPhone will eliminate the 3.5mm headphone jack and instead use a Bluetooth connection and charging jack, which would give Apple room to add a second speaker. Another piece of evidence to back up the news is that back in 2014 Apple allowed headphone makers to make headphone products that were connected through a charging interface. The news is either true or false, and the answer won't be revealed until Apple's autumn 2016 launch. But that doesn't detract from the industry's bullish outlook for the iPhone 7 - which many believe will most likely be Apple's last major upgrade to the iPhone family. Though the iPhone's market share has fallen, according to data released recently by market research firm IDC. Among them, Goldman Sachs maintained a "buy" rating on Apple's stock, while BMO analysts said the iPhone 7 would reap a historic sales performance. At the same time, Hock Tan, CEO of Broadcom, said it was likely that Apple would increase revenue by more than 20 percent in the future, thanks entirely to the launch of the iPhone 7. Seven percent of respondents said they planned to buy the iPhone 7, compared with just four percent two years ago. It is understood that 20 per cent of the current group of users who hold the iPhone 6 or 6Plus plan to buy the iPhone 7, which is a fairly high percentage. Second, there is expert analysis, most of the fruit powder like to replace their iPhone handsets from generation to generation. About 26 percent of all iPhone users have not changed their phone in two years, or nearly 120 million users have had their iPhone for two years, according to the report. Media captionTaiwan has been hit by several earthquakes during the production of the iPhone 7. "TSMC's production facilities have been damaged beyond imagination and could have an impact on the initial supply of the iPhone 7." Contradictions between supply and demand will affect ordinary users, it is time to choose a good channel, the first time low prices to start the genuine iPhone 7. According to people familiar with the matter, recently, Suning executives have been meeting with Apple frequently in order to prepare an adequate supply. The operator has already negotiated with Suning, and predictably, with the deep cooperation between the two sides, it is bound to bring lower prices and more intimate services to users. <span class="highlighted">"At the lowest price, consumers might be able to buy an iPhone 7 for as little as $7 a day," he said.</span> Sufficient supply and a variety of concessions, so that the purchase of the iPhone 7 is no longer "pressure mountain," and Suning's logistics, is to turn this beautiful into a more intuitive experience. Maybe you'll get a call in the middle of the night saying, "Hello, Suning EasyJet, your iPhone 7 is here."</div>

The new generation of the iPhone is going to be slick, popular, and limited, thus if you want to be one of the first one to get a hold of it, be sure to know where to buy it from...like Suning. "This has led to further disappointment in the new phone. It is longer but can't even take videos. This generation of iPhone is terrible." Like the other iPhones, iPhone 7 had its share of secrets before being released. In addition, there are multiple sources claiming that the new generation of iPhone will not feature a 3.5mm headphone jack and use Bluetooth connectivity instead and will just have the charging port. This will provide space for Apple to add a second speaker. As evidence to backup this claim, Apple had developed earphones that would connect to the charging port back in 2014. Regardless of whether the rumors are true or not, we will only know for sure when it is announced in Apple's fall 2016 conference. However, this does not prevent the industry from looking at the potential specification of the iPhone 7 - many believe that the iPhone 7 will most likely be Apple's last major upgrade to the iPhone series. IDC, which is a market research institute recently released data that the market share of iPhone has declined. However, Goldman Sachs will maintain the "buy" rating for Apple's stock, and BMO analysts believe that iPhone7 will come together with a historic sales performance. Additionally, Broadcom’s CEO Hock Tan also stated that Apple’s future revenue growth may exceed 20%, all thanks to the launch of the iPhone 7. Seven percent of respondents said they had plans to purchase the iPhone 7, compared to only four percent who planned to purchase the iPhone 6 two years ago. It is understood that 20% of those currently using the iPhone 6 or 6 Plus plan to purchase the iPhone 7, which is a very high percentage. Also, experts analyzed that most of Apple consumers like to replace their iPhones every generation. According to the data, about 26% of all iPhone users have not changed their phones for 2 years. Which means almost 120 million people have used the iPhone for 2 years. Some media claimed that Taiwan faced several earthquakes during the production of iPhone 7 and, “The damage of TSMC's production facilities was bigger than expected and may affect the initial iPhone 7 supply.” The disparity between supply and demand will affect the average customers. It is time to choose a good place to buy an authentic iPhone 7 early at a lower price. <span class="highlighted">According to informed sources, Suning executives met frequently with Apple in order to prepare enough stock.</span> The company is already in discussion with Suning, and will inevitable provide a lower price and better service for consumers through a high-level of cooperation between the two parties. “At the lowest price, consumers may only need to pay 7 yuan a day to purchase the iPhone 7.” Plentiful stock and various services will make purchasing the iPhone less stressful. Through Suning's logistics, will further lead to a heightened buying experience. You may perhaps get a call in the middle of a night which will say "Hi this is Suning.com. Your iPhone 7 is here."</div>
	<div class="translation" id="134">Although it hasn't been confirmed, numerous sources have said Apple's fall 2016 launch will take place in September, and the iPhone 7 is really coming. Apple didn't respond, but word has spread about the new iPhone's features and configuration, and even pictures of the iPhone 7's "real model" are available online. The next generation of iPhones is "eye-catching", hot, hot, rich and out of stock... If you want to buy the real thing for the first time, make sure you choose a good channel, say, Suning. This added to the frustration over the new phone, "It lengthens, but it doesn't project a hologram at all! This generation of iPhones sucks." The iPhone 7, like other iPhones, has been accompanied by countless secrets before it was born. Also, multiple sources have claimed that the new iPhone will eliminate the 3.5mm headphone jack and instead use a Bluetooth connection and charging jack, which would give Apple room to add a second speaker. Another piece of evidence to back up the news is that back in 2014 Apple allowed headphone makers to make headphone products that were connected through a charging interface. The news is either true or false, and the answer won't be revealed until Apple's autumn 2016 launch. But that doesn't detract from the industry's bullish outlook for the iPhone 7 - which many believe will most likely be Apple's last major upgrade to the iPhone family. Though the iPhone's market share has fallen, according to data released recently by market research firm IDC. Among them, Goldman Sachs maintained a "buy" rating on Apple's stock, while BMO analysts said the iPhone 7 would reap a historic sales performance. At the same time, Hock Tan, CEO of Broadcom, said it was likely that Apple would increase revenue by more than 20 percent in the future, thanks entirely to the launch of the iPhone 7. Seven percent of respondents said they planned to buy the iPhone 7, compared with just four percent two years ago. It is understood that 20 per cent of the current group of users who hold the iPhone 6 or 6Plus plan to buy the iPhone 7, which is a fairly high percentage. Second, there is expert analysis, most of the fruit powder like to replace their iPhone handsets from generation to generation. About 26 percent of all iPhone users have not changed their phone in two years, or nearly 120 million users have had their iPhone for two years, according to the report. Media captionTaiwan has been hit by several earthquakes during the production of the iPhone 7. "TSMC's production facilities have been damaged beyond imagination and could have an impact on the initial supply of the iPhone 7." Contradictions between supply and demand will affect ordinary users, it is time to choose a good channel, the first time low prices to start the genuine iPhone 7. <span class="highlighted">According to people familiar with the matter, recently, Suning executives have been meeting with Apple frequently in order to prepare an adequate supply.</span> The operator has already negotiated with Suning, and predictably, with the deep cooperation between the two sides, it is bound to bring lower prices and more intimate services to users. "At the lowest price, consumers might be able to buy an iPhone 7 for as little as $7 a day," he said. Sufficient supply and a variety of concessions, so that the purchase of the iPhone 7 is no longer "pressure mountain," and Suning's logistics, is to turn this beautiful into a more intuitive experience. Maybe you'll get a call in the middle of the night saying, "Hello, Suning EasyJet, your iPhone 7 is here."</div>

	<div class="translation" id="137">According to statistics of the Chongqing Municipal Meteorological Bureau portal on the high-temperature weather in various districts and counties except Fuyang, the rest of the city may have a deviance on the high temperature. Currently, there are at least 28 provinces in China that have clearly defined the standards for the subsidy. However, the standards issued by provinces and cities are not the same. Chongqing, on one other hand, receives heat allowances in the form of heat allowances on weekdays. If the temperature is 35°C to 37°C , a rate of not less than 10 yuan per person per day; if it exceeds 37°C, the rate shall not be less than 15 yuan per person per day. Workers working in high temperature environment above 40°C can receive up to 20 yuan per day per month (except for laborers who already receive the heat allowance according to law). According to this standard, Kaizhou, had the most days of high-temperature weather last month, and was able to receive 330 yuan, and Chengkou had the least number of days which equated to 80 yuan. The highest temperature recorded in Puyang did not reach the high temperature standard, so there was no heat allowance. In the past, many would give cold drinks instead of heat allowances. The City Work Safety Administration stated that such practices are not in line with current regulations. The employer may not deduct or reduce the wages of workers due to the stoppage of work due to high temperature and reduce working hours. The Municipal Bureau of Human Resources and Social Affairs stated that when an employee faces a situation where a the work environment is considered high-temperature but does not receive a heat allowance, he or she can seek legal rights through the labor dispute mediation agency where the company is located, or call 12333 to file a complaint. Where a company refuses to issue a heat allowance, the laborer may complain to the appropriate department in human resources and social security at or above the county level where the employment is located. Also, because heat allowances are part of wages and not benefits, they must be included in total wages and deducted from taxes. <span class="highlighted">Therefore, the heat allowance is not part of the minimum wage and must be paid in cash. It cannot be replaced with physical items such as drinks.</span></div>
	<div class="translation" id="137">Statistics on high temperature days of various districts provided on portal website of the Chongqing City Meteorological Administration said that with the exception of Youyang County, every area in the city could receive varying amounts of high temperature subsidies. Currently, at least 28 provinces in the country have clarified their subsidy disbursement criteria, but the disbursement criteria differs among provinces. In Chongqing, high-temperature subsidy is received based on subsidy for high-temperature working days. At temperatures equal or more than 35℃ and less than 37℃, each person shall be given a fee of not less than RMB10 per day. At temperatures higher than 37℃, each person shall be given a fee of not less than RMB15 per day. Workers working at above a temperature of 40℃ can receive a monthly subsidy of up to 20 RMB per day (this does not apply to a worker who is already provided with a high temperature operation subsidy according to law). According to this criteria, Kaizhou, which experienced the most number of high-temperature days last month would receive RMB330, while Chengkou which experienced the least number of days would received RMB80. As the highest temperature in Youyang did not exceed the high temperature benchmark, it did not receive any high-temperature subsidy. In the past, many companies often use cooling and refreshing beverages to offset the high temperature subsidy. The city administration of work safety, however, expressed that this act is not compliant to the current laws. Employers may not deduct or reduce the salary of laborers if work has to be suspended or work time reduced due to high temperatures. The municipal human resources and social security bureau said that workers who worked under high temperatures without receiving high temperature allowance may fight for their legal rights by way of the labor dispute mediation mechanism, or call 12333 to file a complaint. In case employer refuse to pay high-temperature allowance, employee is entitled to complain to the local administrative authority of HR and social security at the county level. Also, since the high temperature subsidy is considered part of the salary and not a benefit, it is included in total salary and subject to the personal income tax. <span class="highlighted">High temperature subsidies are not included considered part of the minimum wage and must be issued in the form of cash. They cannot be replaced in the form of beverages or other tangible items.</span></div>
	<div class="translation" id="137">According to the Chongqing Meteorological Bureau portal to the high temperature of the counties statistics, in addition to Youyang, the rest of the city can receive different degrees of high temperature allowance. At least 28 provinces across the country have now clarified the criteria for the payment of allowances, although the criteria are not the same in the provinces and municipalities, while Chongqing receives a high-temperature allowance in the form of a high-temperature working day allowance. If the temperature is above 35 ° C and below 37 ° C, the standard is not less than 10 yuan per person per day, and if the temperature is above 37 ° C, the standard is not less than 15 yuan per person per day. High temperature workers above 40 ℃ are entitled to a monthly allowance of up to 20 yuan / day (except for those workers who have already enjoyed the post allowance for high temperature operation in accordance with the law). According to this standard, last month, the highest number of days of hot weather in Kaizhou can receive 330 yuan, the number of days the least Chengkou is 80 yuan, and Youyang the highest temperature due to not meet the high temperature standards, so there is no high temperature allowance. In the past, many units would offset the high temperature allowance with refreshing drinks. The City Safety Supervision Bureau said that this practice was not in line with the current practice. The employing units shall not deduct or reduce the wages of the workers if they stop working or shorten their working hours due to the hot weather. The city's social service bureau said employees who have not received a high temperature allowance for working in high temperatures can fight for their legitimate rights and interests through the labor dispute mediation agency where the business is located, or call 12333 to lodge a complaint. If an employing unit refuses to pay a high-temperature allowance, the worker may file a complaint with the department in charge of human resources and social security at or above the county level in the place where the employee is employed. At the same time, since the high temperature allowance is part of the salary and not a benefit, it is included in the total salary and deducted from the tax. <span class="highlighted">The high temperature allowance is therefore not covered by the minimum wage and must be paid in cash and cannot be substituted in kind, such as beverages.</span></div>

	<div class="source" id="142">很多NBA球员都证明了自己的实力。但是有人进步就有人衰落。 无论是因为年龄的增大还是出场时间被限制，每个赛季都有一些球员的表现会出现退步。 当然了，有些“退步”可能仅仅是数据的缩水，这些球员的实力可能并未下降。 即便韦德仍是联盟里最好的得分后卫之一，但是他在公牛的表现应该不会有热火那么好了。 他和隆多组成的后场射程有限，当家球星巴特勒的三分命中率也只有32.8%，这让他们下赛季的进攻会打得很拥挤。 来到了风城，闪电侠势必把球权更多地让给巴特勒和隆多，自己很可能在常规赛选择养生打法。 奥卡福的情况比较尴尬，作为上赛季76人的第一选择，他在新赛季不得不和西蒙斯以及恩比德竞争上场时间和球权。 这一竞争可能不会来的很快，西蒙斯还需要适应NBA赛场，恩比德也要尽快从伤病中完全恢复，但是奥卡福能否在76人的长人阵中有位置还是个问题。 上个赛季，奥卡福32%的得分来自低位进攻，这一比例高于考辛斯、武切维奇和布鲁克·洛佩斯，同时他的使用率也高居联盟前40。 随着西蒙斯已经展现了出色的控球前锋潜质，恩比德也拥有着更适合NBA比赛的身材，奥卡福的地位恐怕很难再那么稳固了。 <span class="highlighted">过去两个赛季，汤普森的使用率已经稳定在了联盟前20，而这也是他生涯最出色的两个赛季。</span> 不过问题是，随着杜兰特的到来，汤普森的使用率一定会下降，这势必将影响他的发挥。 这一影响将不仅是出手次数的影响，汤神的持球进攻在下赛季肯定也会大大减少，这在某些方面也会降低对手对他的防守难度。 杜兰特的到来一定会让勇士队的球员们数据缩水，但这其中缩水最严重的恐怕就是汤普森了。 但这并不意味着汤神的水平退步，这更像是他为球队整体做出了牺牲。 帕克在上个赛季表现得比数据反映的要好些，不仅是因为他的篮下效率来到了生涯最高，他和阿尔德里奇的化学反应也让马刺队受益。 邓肯退役，吉诺比利宣布再战一年，GDP的组合最终也走到了尽头，作为三个人里最年轻的一个，法国跑车的油箱里也没有多少油了。 在得到了第三枚总冠军戒指之后，只有贾巴尔、乔丹和拉塞尔比詹姆斯赢得了更多的常规赛MVP，而乔丹是唯一一个FMVP比詹姆斯多的人。 哦，对了，詹姆斯刚刚为克利夫兰带来了过去52年里第一座职业体育冠军奖杯。 来到了职业生涯第14个赛季的詹姆斯需要更好的保证体力，为季后赛做好准备。 因此，在常规赛里，詹姆斯的数据很可能进一步下滑，他会把更多的重担分给欧文来承担，不过他仍然会轻松地成为联盟前三的球员。</div>
	<div class="translation" id="142">A lot of NBA players have proven themselves, but some have improved and others have declined. Whether it's because of increased age or limited playing time, there are a number of players who have regressed every season. Of course, some of the "regressions" may simply be data shrinkage, and the strength of these players may not have diminished. Even though Wade is still one of the best shooting guards in the league, he probably won't do as well with the Bulls as the Heat. He and Rondo have limited backcourt range and the establishment star Butler is shooting just 32.8 percent from three-point range, making their offense crowded for next season. Coming to Windy City, the Blitzkrieg is bound to cede more of the ball to Butler and Rondo, and he is likely to choose a regimen to play during the regular season. Okafor is in an awkward position, having to compete with Simmons and Embiid for playing time and ball rights in the new season as the first choice for the 76ers last season. The rivalry may not come soon, Simmons will have to adapt to the NBA and Embiid will have to fully recover from the injury as soon as possible, but Okafor's place in the 76ers' lineup remains a question. Okafor scored 32 percent from the low post offense last season, a higher percentage than Cousins, Vucevic and Brooke Lopez, while his usage rates were also high in the league's top 40. With Simmons already showing excellent possession forward potential and Embiid in better shape for NBA games, Okafor's position is likely to be hard to get any more secure. <span class="highlighted">Thompson's usage has stabilized in the league's top 20 over the past two seasons, the best of his career.</span> The problem, though, is that Thompson's usage is bound to decline with Durant's arrival, and that's bound to affect his play. The impact will be not only in terms of the number of shots taken, but the Towns' holding offense will certainly be significantly reduced next season, which in some ways will also make it easier for opponents to defend him. Durant's arrival is sure to shrink the Warriors' player numbers, but it's probably Thompson who has lost the most. But that doesn't mean that Tommy's level has regressed, it's more like he's made sacrifices for the team as a whole. Parker did better last season than the numbers suggest, not only because his basketball efficiency was at its highest in his career, but also because his chemistry with Aldridge benefited the Spurs. Duncan retired, Ginobili announced another year of fighting, and the GDP combination finally came to an end, and as the youngest of the three, the French sports car didn't have much fuel in its tank. After getting their third championship ring, only Abdul-Jabbar, Jordan and Russell won more regular-season MVPs than James, and Jordan was the only one with more than James. Oh, and by the way, James has just brought Cleveland its first Pro Sports Championship trophy in the last 52 years. James, who arrived in his 14th season of his career, needs to be better guaranteed physical strength and ready for the playoffs. As a result, James' numbers are likely to slide further during the regular season, and he'll share more of the burden with Irving, though he'll still be an easy top-three player in the league.</div>
	<div class="translation" id="142">Many NBA players have proven themselves, but progress for some meant regress for others. Due to aging or restrictions on playing time, performance of several players may become worse for each season. Of course, some of this "degeneration" could be attributed to lowered statistics, but the true ability of these players probably stayed the same. Although Wade is still regarded as one of the best shooting guards in the NBA, his performance with the Bulls will unlikely be as good as when he was at Miami Heat. He and Rondo has limited perimeter shot range, and their superstar Butler only has a 32.8% chance of scoring with a three-point shot. Offenses they head for the next season will be extremely crowded. After arriving at the Windy City, Wade "the Lightning" will, where possible, pass the ball to Butler and Rondo while he himself adopts a more wholesome gameplay strategy in conventional games. Okafor's position is quite precarious. As the only option for the 76ers in the last season, he was forced to jostle with Simons and Embiid for play time and ownership of the ball during the new season. This competition may not be imminent. Simmons still has to adapt to the NBA game. Embiid also has to fully recover from his injuries as soon as possible. Whether Okafor will hold a permanent position in the 76ers however, remains questionable. In the previous season, Okafor's 32% scoring rate was attributed to low post offense. This ratio was higher than that of Cousins, Vučević, and Brook Lopez. His usage rate is also amongst the top-40 of the entire NBA. As Simmons has demonstrated great potential as a point forward and Embiid is starting to get a physique more suitable for NBA games, Okafor's position will only become less stable. <span class="highlighted">For the last two seasons, Thompson has been one of the top-20 most commonly fielded players in the NBA. Those were his most impressive two seasons in his entire career.</span> The problem is that with the arrival of Durant, the chance for having Thompson play in the games will definitely drop, further lowering his chances of performing. This not only affected the chances for Thompson to play the game, his field goal attempts will be vastly reduced in the next season, and reduce the challenges faced by his opponents when defending against him. The arrival of Durant will definitely result in a drop in numbers among Warriors' players, but Thompson will probably have the most to lose. This does not mean that Thompson's standards have dropped. In fact, it appears that he's making sacrifices for the sake of the entire team. Parker's performance last season was better than his stats suggested. Not only did Parker achieve his career best in rebound efficiency, his chemistry with Aldridge also benefited the Spurs. Duncan has retired, while Ginóbili announced that he will play for another year. The GDP combination has finally come to an end. As the youngest of the three, there is little gas in the tank of the French sports car. Only Jabbar, Jordan, and Russell won more standard MVP games than James after obtaining their third championship rings. Jordan is the only person with more FMVP than James. O yes, James has just helped deliver the first professional sports championship trophy to Cleveland in 52 years. James, who is in the 14th season of his professional career, needs to better retain his physical strength to prepare well for the playoffs. Therefore, during the regular season, James' stats may well decline further. He will share more of his burden with Owen but he will easily remain one of the top 3 NBA players.</div>
	<div class="translation" id="142">Many NBA players are able to prove their ability to play but there are people who fall off. Whether it is due to age or limited playing time, there are always players who gets worse each season. Of course those deemed to have "gotten worse" may just be due to the limited stats and data, and they may actually not have gotten worse. Despite Dwayne Wade being one of the top shooting guards in the league, he will probably not perform as well with the Bulls than he did back with the Heat. The backcourt range of Wade and Rondo is limited and Butler who is the star player only has a 32.8% 3-point percentage. This will make their offence limited in the next season. In the windy city, the Flash (Wade) needs to give control of the ball more to Butler and Rondo, while he takes a more conservative approach and stay healthy. Okafor's situation is more awkward. Despite being the number one draft for the 76ers last season, he has to compete with Simmons and Embiid for playing time and ball in the upcoming season. Playing for the spot won't be right away as Simmons still needs to get used to the NBA games, and Embiid need to quickly recover from injuries. The issue remains if Okafor will be able to stay in the 76'ers roster in the long run. Last season, Okafor' was scoring 32% from the low post, which is higher than Cousins, Vucevic, and Brook Lopez. He also has a usage rate of 40 in the league. With Simmons already showing excellent potential as a forward, and Embiid having good potential for the NBA, it may be difficult for Okafor to find a stable role. <span class="highlighted">In the past two seasons, Thompson's usage rate has stabilized at the top 20 in the league, and his last two seasons has been the best in his career.</span> However, with Durant joining the team, the issues would be that Thompson's use rate will certainly decline, and is bound to affect his performance. This will impact his shots taken and will surely reduce greatly next season and make the opponent defend him easier. The arrival of Durant will limit the stats of the Warrior's players, and the player that would be the most affected would most likely be Thompson. But this does not mean Thompson's playing ability will get worse. It is more a matter of fact that he will need to make some sacrifice for the team. Parker performed better than the data reflected last season, not only because his efficiency was at the highest level of his career, but his chemistry with Aldridge also benefited the Spurs. With Duncan retiring and Ginobili playing one last season, the era of Ginobili, Duncan and Parker will finally come to an end. As the youngest of the three, there is not much gas left in the tank for the French import. After winning the third championship ring, only Jabbar, Jordan and Russell and James won more regular-season MVPs, and Jordan is the only person with more Finals MVP than James. Oh and James has just brought home Cleveland's first professional sports championship cup in 52 years. In LeBron's 14 season of his career, he will need to maintain his physical condition to prepare for the playoffs. His stats will probably decline in the regular season as give the ball more to Osman. However, he will still easily be the top three players in the league.</div>

	<div class="translation" id="147">Qingdao is the 12th city in the nation and the first in Shandong Province to implement the pilot program for paying for the use and trading of emissions rights. On the 11th, many companies submitted emission rights purchase applications at the Qingdao Emissions Trading Center. Those who successfully applied for the rights will start paying a usage fee. <span class="highlighted">The imminent completion of this first trade also marks the official launch of the pilot program for the trading of emission rights in Qingdao. This will also be the first emission rights trade in the Province as well as the first city-level  emission rights trade in the nation.</span> In the morning of the 11th, Zhao Xiuping, general manager of Qingdao Shuangtao Jingxi Chemical Industry (Group) came to the Qingdao City Emissions Trading Center to submit an application to purchase emission rights. This corporation, situated in the factory area of Old Town of Qingdao, stopped its production lines at the end of last year, and was moved, using environment-friendly means, to a new plant area in Pingdu. Zhao Xiuping submitted the application form, environmental impact report, and other materials for the construction project. The Qingdao City Emissions Reserve and Trading Service Center began preliminary reviews of the application materials. According to the collection criteria determined by Qingdao's pricing, finance and other departments, the  initial usage fee for emissions rights is currently estimated at approximately RMB641,200. Staff will complete checking and ratification within seven working days. The first transaction, which will be completed soon, also marks the formal initiation of the Qingdao Emissions Trading Pilot Project. This will also be the first emissions trading in the province and the first city-level emissions trading in the entire country. Zhao Xiuping said, "Presently, enterprises have invested RMB400 million in environmental protection. On the surface, this seems an enormous amount, but it has a profound impact on both the operational and management philosophy of enterprises as well as social benefit, and has provided room for innovative management by enterprises. On that day, Qingdao Sifang Xincheng Zhizhuo Coach Components Co., Ltd. also came to apply for and purchase emission rights for the project to produce 4,200 pieces of interior accessories and components for high speed train and electric multiple units. This project is initiated by a mechanical processing company. The company is applying for an initial emissions as chemical oxygen demand (COD) of 0.514 tons/year and ammonia nitrogen (NOX) of 0.052 tons/year. Paying for the use and trading of air pollutant emissions rights is for the city's key power and heat production and supply industrial enterprises. Existing polluting companies that have received a bad rating prior to January 1, 2016 will be temporarily exempt from the usage fee. "Paying for emission rights does not mean gaining the right to generate illegal emissions. The payer may not emit waste as they like." Deputy Director Han Hongyan of the Qingdao Environmental Protection Bureau explained that illegal emissions or emissions that exceed specified limits shall be subject to penalties according to relevant laws. Violating companies will not be able to purchase emission rights to avoid punishments. In another word, we should fight against environmental offense and  excessive discharge by enterprises with serious legal action to protect our environment and public health. Enterprises are now more enthusiastic about pollution treatment because of their own interests; limited emission rights are valued, and emission of pollutants has decreased. Driven by economic interest, reducing emission of pollutants will shift from mandatory acts imposed by the government to conscious corporate market behavior. Thus, the goal of protecting the environment and nature as well as ensuring public health will be achieved. The right to discharge pollutants, or "emission rights", are a right to emit pollutants, i.e., polluters, within a quota allocated by the government, enjoy the right to discharge pollutants into the environment according to the law. This right is in essence, the right polluters have on the ownership, use and profit of existing resources in the environment. In the next step, under the pretext of keeping total emissions within the allowable emission volume, various internal sources of pollution shall use currency exchange to modulate emissions. Emissions trading was first proposed by the US economist Dales in 1968. In the 1970s, the US made use of this to manage sources of atmospheric and river pollution. Pilot programs were initiated since 2007. Currently, the program is being fully implemented at Zhejiang, Jiangsu, and other 14 provinces (in districts and cities).</div>

On the 11th, many companies came to the Qingdao's Emission Trading Center to submit their carbon trading application and will pay the permit fees once it is processed. <span class="highlighted">The first trading done represents that the carbon emission trading pilot program has officially started, and will be the first in the province to introduce the emission trading scheme at the city-level.</span> On the morning of the 11th, Zhao Xiuping, the president of Qingdao Shuangtao Jingxi Chemical Industry (Group) Limited Company, came to the Qingdao Emissions Trading Center to submit an application to purchase an emission permit. The same company had a plant in Qingdao's old town but was shut down last year and relocated to Pingdu for environmental concerns. After Zhao Xiuping submitted the construction and environmental assessment permit application, the Qingdao Emissions Trading Center started to do a preliminary review of the submitted application. The estimated initial emission fee is approximately 641,200 yuan according to the collection standards set by Qingdao Pricing Administration. The staff will process and verify it within 7 business days. The first trading done represents that the carbon emission trading pilot program has officially started, and will be the first in the province to introduce the emission trading scheme at the city-level. Zhao Xiuping mentioned that he has invested RMB 400 million on corporate environmental responsibility. Despite being a large amount of money put into this, it greatly impacts the company's philosophy, social responsibility, and also opens up a new level of innovation management. On the same day, Qingdao Sifang Xincheng Zhizhuo Coach Parts Co., Ltd. also came to purchase emission permits for their annual production of 4,200 pieces of high-speed rail and EMU (Electrical Multiple Unit) interior parts. This project was for the machining companies, with initial emission amount of 0.514 ton/yr of COD, and 0.052 ton/yr of NOX on their application. The carbon emission trading is an important business to support electricity and heat for the city. The carbon credits obtained from EIA before January 1, 2016 will not be charged with the usage fee for the time being. "Purchasing an emission permit does not grant permission to freely discharge illegal pollutants." Han Hongyan, the Deputy Director of the Environmental Protection Bureau of Qingdao stated the those who discharge illegal pollutants and excessive pollutants will still be punished according to the regulation; those discharging illegal discharge of pollutants and excessive discharge of pollutants will still have to be punished in accordance with relevant regulations, and companies will not be able to purchase emission permits to avoid punishment for illegal or excessive discharges. Basically, through legal measures and being stringent on environmental violations and to punish companies for excessive discharges, we will be able to protect the environment and the health of the public. Companies have now put their focus on managing emissions for their own benefit and appreciate limiting the emission amount which has lead to a reduction of pollutants being discharged. With the economic benefits being a factor, the government's bold action has lead to company's to react to take action on reducing emissions. This will all lead to protecting the environment, nature, and the health of the public. The right to emit pollutants, also known as “emissions permit”. It refers to the right of emitters to discharge pollutants to the environment within the limits allocated by the government. This type of right limits the footprint of the polluters in the environment and a right to gain revenue. The next step, assuming that the discharged pollutant does not exceed the limit is to control the emission amount  through carbon emission trading. Emissions trading was proposed by American economist John Dales back in 1968. Since the 1970s in the 20th Century, the United States has applied it to control pollution in the atmosphere and river. China has been doing trials since 2007, and has implemented it in 14 provinces (in regions and cities) including Zhejiang and Jiangsu.</div>
	<div class="translation" id="147">Qingdao is the 12th in China and the first pilot city of paid use and trading of emission rights in Shandong Province. 11, a number of enterprises came to Qingdao Municipal Emission Trading Center to submit applications for the purchase of emission rights, purchase acceptance will pay a fee. <span class="highlighted">The transaction is about to complete the first single also indicates that Qingdao emissions trading pilot work officially kicked off, which will be the province's emissions trading first single and the first nationwide city-level emissions trading.</span> On the morning of November 11, Zhao Xiuping, general manager of Qingdao Shuangtao Fine Chemical Industry (Group) Co., Ltd. came to Qingdao Emission Trading Center to submit the application for emission rights. The enterprise is located in the old city of Qingdao plant at the end of last year to stop production, environmental protection moved to the new plant in Pingdu. After Zhao Xiuping submitted the application form, the environmental impact statement of the construction project and other materials, the Qingdao Municipal Emission Right Reserve and Trading Service Center began the preliminary examination of the application materials. According to Qingdao prices, finance and other departments to determine the collection standards, the current estimated initial sewage right to use about 644.12 million yuan, staff will be completed within seven working days to verify. The transaction is about to complete the first single also indicates that Qingdao emission trading pilot work officially kicked off, will also be the province's emission trading first single and the first national city-level emissions trading. Zhao Xiuping said: At present, enterprises have invested 400 million in environmental protection, a huge amount on the surface, but the concept of business management, social benefits have a great impact on the enterprise innovation and management has also opened up space. On the same day, Qingdao Sifang Xinchengzhizhuo Bus Accessories Co., Ltd. has also come to the annual output of 4,200 high-speed rail and EMU interior accessories projects to purchase emission rights. The project belongs to the mechanical processing enterprises, the application for the initial emission of chemical oxygen demand (COD) 0.514 tons / year, ammonia nitrogen (NOX) 0.052 tons / year. Air pollutant emission rights paid use and trade for the city's electricity, thermal production and supply of key industrial enterprises. Existing units that have obtained an EIA prior to January 1, 2016, will not be charged a toll fee for the time being. "Paid access to emission permits is not the same as access to the power of illegal discharge of pollutants, and can not be arbitrarily discharged pollutants." Han Hongyan, deputy director of Qingdao Municipal Environmental Protection Bureau, said that if illegal discharge, excessive discharge should still be punished in accordance with the relevant regulations, it is impossible to allow illegal enterprises through the purchase of pollution rights to avoid punishment. In other words, through legal means to crack down on environmental violations, and severely punish enterprises for excessive pollution, so as to protect the environment and protect public health. Now enterprises for their own interests, improve the enthusiasm of pollution control, cherish the limited emission rights, reducing the emission of pollutants. Driven by the economic benefits, reducing the emission of pollutants will change from the government's compulsory behavior to the enterprise's conscious market behavior, so as to truly achieve the goal of protecting the environment, protecting nature and protecting public health. Emission right, also known as "emission right", is the right to discharge pollutants, which refers to the right of the emitter to discharge pollutants into the environment within the quota allocated by the government according to law. This right is essentially the right of the polluter to possess, use and benefit from the environmental capacity resources. Next, under the premise that the total amount of pollutants discharged does not exceed the permitted amount, the amount of pollutants discharged is adjusted by means of currency exchange between the internal sources of pollution. Since the emission trading was put forward by American economist Dales in 1968, it has been applied to the management of air and river pollution sources in the United States since the 1970s. China began to carry out pilot projects in 2007, and 14 provinces (autonomous regions and municipalities), including Zhejiang and Jiangsu, have been fully implemented.</div>

	<div class="source" id="148">很多NBA球员都证明了自己的实力。但是有人进步就有人衰落。 无论是因为年龄的增大还是出场时间被限制，每个赛季都有一些球员的表现会出现退步。 当然了，有些“退步”可能仅仅是数据的缩水，这些球员的实力可能并未下降。 即便韦德仍是联盟里最好的得分后卫之一，但是他在公牛的表现应该不会有热火那么好了。 他和隆多组成的后场射程有限，当家球星巴特勒的三分命中率也只有32.8%，这让他们下赛季的进攻会打得很拥挤。 来到了风城，闪电侠势必把球权更多地让给巴特勒和隆多，自己很可能在常规赛选择养生打法。 奥卡福的情况比较尴尬，作为上赛季76人的第一选择，他在新赛季不得不和西蒙斯以及恩比德竞争上场时间和球权。 这一竞争可能不会来的很快，西蒙斯还需要适应NBA赛场，恩比德也要尽快从伤病中完全恢复，但是奥卡福能否在76人的长人阵中有位置还是个问题。 上个赛季，奥卡福32%的得分来自低位进攻，这一比例高于考辛斯、武切维奇和布鲁克·洛佩斯，同时他的使用率也高居联盟前40。 随着西蒙斯已经展现了出色的控球前锋潜质，恩比德也拥有着更适合NBA比赛的身材，奥卡福的地位恐怕很难再那么稳固了。 过去两个赛季，汤普森的使用率已经稳定在了联盟前20，而这也是他生涯最出色的两个赛季。 <span class="highlighted">不过问题是，随着杜兰特的到来，汤普森的使用率一定会下降，这势必将影响他的发挥。</span> 这一影响将不仅是出手次数的影响，汤神的持球进攻在下赛季肯定也会大大减少，这在某些方面也会降低对手对他的防守难度。 杜兰特的到来一定会让勇士队的球员们数据缩水，但这其中缩水最严重的恐怕就是汤普森了。 但这并不意味着汤神的水平退步，这更像是他为球队整体做出了牺牲。 帕克在上个赛季表现得比数据反映的要好些，不仅是因为他的篮下效率来到了生涯最高，他和阿尔德里奇的化学反应也让马刺队受益。 邓肯退役，吉诺比利宣布再战一年，GDP的组合最终也走到了尽头，作为三个人里最年轻的一个，法国跑车的油箱里也没有多少油了。 在得到了第三枚总冠军戒指之后，只有贾巴尔、乔丹和拉塞尔比詹姆斯赢得了更多的常规赛MVP，而乔丹是唯一一个FMVP比詹姆斯多的人。 哦，对了，詹姆斯刚刚为克利夫兰带来了过去52年里第一座职业体育冠军奖杯。 来到了职业生涯第14个赛季的詹姆斯需要更好的保证体力，为季后赛做好准备。 因此，在常规赛里，詹姆斯的数据很可能进一步下滑，他会把更多的重担分给欧文来承担，不过他仍然会轻松地成为联盟前三的球员。</div>
	<div class="translation" id="148">Many NBA players are able to prove their ability to play but there are people who fall off. Whether it is due to age or limited playing time, there are always players who gets worse each season. Of course those deemed to have "gotten worse" may just be due to the limited stats and data, and they may actually not have gotten worse. Despite Dwayne Wade being one of the top shooting guards in the league, he will probably not perform as well with the Bulls than he did back with the Heat. The backcourt range of Wade and Rondo is limited and Butler who is the star player only has a 32.8% 3-point percentage. This will make their offence limited in the next season. In the windy city, the Flash (Wade) needs to give control of the ball more to Butler and Rondo, while he takes a more conservative approach and stay healthy. Okafor's situation is more awkward. Despite being the number one draft for the 76ers last season, he has to compete with Simmons and Embiid for playing time and ball in the upcoming season. Playing for the spot won't be right away as Simmons still needs to get used to the NBA games, and Embiid need to quickly recover from injuries. The issue remains if Okafor will be able to stay in the 76'ers roster in the long run. Last season, Okafor' was scoring 32% from the low post, which is higher than Cousins, Vucevic, and Brook Lopez. He also has a usage rate of 40 in the league. With Simmons already showing excellent potential as a forward, and Embiid having good potential for the NBA, it may be difficult for Okafor to find a stable role. In the past two seasons, Thompson's usage rate has stabilized at the top 20 in the league, and his last two seasons has been the best in his career. <span class="highlighted">However, with Durant joining the team, the issues would be that Thompson's use rate will certainly decline, and is bound to affect his performance.</span> This will impact his shots taken and will surely reduce greatly next season and make the opponent defend him easier. The arrival of Durant will limit the stats of the Warrior's players, and the player that would be the most affected would most likely be Thompson. But this does not mean Thompson's playing ability will get worse. It is more a matter of fact that he will need to make some sacrifice for the team. Parker performed better than the data reflected last season, not only because his efficiency was at the highest level of his career, but his chemistry with Aldridge also benefited the Spurs. With Duncan retiring and Ginobili playing one last season, the era of Ginobili, Duncan and Parker will finally come to an end. As the youngest of the three, there is not much gas left in the tank for the French import. After winning the third championship ring, only Jabbar, Jordan and Russell and James won more regular-season MVPs, and Jordan is the only person with more Finals MVP than James. Oh and James has just brought home Cleveland's first professional sports championship cup in 52 years. In LeBron's 14 season of his career, he will need to maintain his physical condition to prepare for the playoffs. His stats will probably decline in the regular season as give the ball more to Osman. However, he will still easily be the top three players in the league.</div>
	<div class="translation" id="148">Many NBA players have proven themselves, but progress for some meant regress for others. Due to aging or restrictions on playing time, performance of several players may become worse for each season. Of course, some of this "degeneration" could be attributed to lowered statistics, but the true ability of these players probably stayed the same. Although Wade is still regarded as one of the best shooting guards in the NBA, his performance with the Bulls will unlikely be as good as when he was at Miami Heat. He and Rondo has limited perimeter shot range, and their superstar Butler only has a 32.8% chance of scoring with a three-point shot. Offenses they head for the next season will be extremely crowded. After arriving at the Windy City, Wade "the Lightning" will, where possible, pass the ball to Butler and Rondo while he himself adopts a more wholesome gameplay strategy in conventional games. Okafor's position is quite precarious. As the only option for the 76ers in the last season, he was forced to jostle with Simons and Embiid for play time and ownership of the ball during the new season. This competition may not be imminent. Simmons still has to adapt to the NBA game. Embiid also has to fully recover from his injuries as soon as possible. Whether Okafor will hold a permanent position in the 76ers however, remains questionable. In the previous season, Okafor's 32% scoring rate was attributed to low post offense. This ratio was higher than that of Cousins, Vučević, and Brook Lopez. His usage rate is also amongst the top-40 of the entire NBA. As Simmons has demonstrated great potential as a point forward and Embiid is starting to get a physique more suitable for NBA games, Okafor's position will only become less stable. For the last two seasons, Thompson has been one of the top-20 most commonly fielded players in the NBA. Those were his most impressive two seasons in his entire career. <span class="highlighted">The problem is that with the arrival of Durant, the chance for having Thompson play in the games will definitely drop, further lowering his chances of performing.</span> This not only affected the chances for Thompson to play the game, his field goal attempts will be vastly reduced in the next season, and reduce the challenges faced by his opponents when defending against him. The arrival of Durant will definitely result in a drop in numbers among Warriors' players, but Thompson will probably have the most to lose. This does not mean that Thompson's standards have dropped. In fact, it appears that he's making sacrifices for the sake of the entire team. Parker's performance last season was better than his stats suggested. Not only did Parker achieve his career best in rebound efficiency, his chemistry with Aldridge also benefited the Spurs. Duncan has retired, while Ginóbili announced that he will play for another year. The GDP combination has finally come to an end. As the youngest of the three, there is little gas in the tank of the French sports car. Only Jabbar, Jordan, and Russell won more standard MVP games than James after obtaining their third championship rings. Jordan is the only person with more FMVP than James. O yes, James has just helped deliver the first professional sports championship trophy to Cleveland in 52 years. James, who is in the 14th season of his professional career, needs to better retain his physical strength to prepare well for the playoffs. Therefore, during the regular season, James' stats may well decline further. He will share more of his burden with Owen but he will easily remain one of the top 3 NBA players.</div>
	<div class="translation" id="148">A lot of NBA players have proven themselves, but some have improved and others have declined. Whether it's because of increased age or limited playing time, there are a number of players who have regressed every season. Of course, some of the "regressions" may simply be data shrinkage, and the strength of these players may not have diminished. Even though Wade is still one of the best shooting guards in the league, he probably won't do as well with the Bulls as the Heat. He and Rondo have limited backcourt range and the establishment star Butler is shooting just 32.8 percent from three-point range, making their offense crowded for next season. Coming to Windy City, the Blitzkrieg is bound to cede more of the ball to Butler and Rondo, and he is likely to choose a regimen to play during the regular season. Okafor is in an awkward position, having to compete with Simmons and Embiid for playing time and ball rights in the new season as the first choice for the 76ers last season. The rivalry may not come soon, Simmons will have to adapt to the NBA and Embiid will have to fully recover from the injury as soon as possible, but Okafor's place in the 76ers' lineup remains a question. Okafor scored 32 percent from the low post offense last season, a higher percentage than Cousins, Vucevic and Brooke Lopez, while his usage rates were also high in the league's top 40. With Simmons already showing excellent possession forward potential and Embiid in better shape for NBA games, Okafor's position is likely to be hard to get any more secure. Thompson's usage has stabilized in the league's top 20 over the past two seasons, the best of his career. <span class="highlighted">The problem, though, is that Thompson's usage is bound to decline with Durant's arrival, and that's bound to affect his play.</span> The impact will be not only in terms of the number of shots taken, but the Towns' holding offense will certainly be significantly reduced next season, which in some ways will also make it easier for opponents to defend him. Durant's arrival is sure to shrink the Warriors' player numbers, but it's probably Thompson who has lost the most. But that doesn't mean that Tommy's level has regressed, it's more like he's made sacrifices for the team as a whole. Parker did better last season than the numbers suggest, not only because his basketball efficiency was at its highest in his career, but also because his chemistry with Aldridge benefited the Spurs. Duncan retired, Ginobili announced another year of fighting, and the GDP combination finally came to an end, and as the youngest of the three, the French sports car didn't have much fuel in its tank. After getting their third championship ring, only Abdul-Jabbar, Jordan and Russell won more regular-season MVPs than James, and Jordan was the only one with more than James. Oh, and by the way, James has just brought Cleveland its first Pro Sports Championship trophy in the last 52 years. James, who arrived in his 14th season of his career, needs to be better guaranteed physical strength and ready for the playoffs. As a result, James' numbers are likely to slide further during the regular season, and he'll share more of the burden with Irving, though he'll still be an easy top-three player in the league.</div>

"2016 Yulan Cultural Festival" held in Victoria Park.</span> There will be drum music, traditional snacks, fancy decorations, and crowds of people. The "2016 Yulan Cultural Festival" organized by the Federation of Hong Kong Chiu Chow Community Organizations was held in Victoria Park from the 12th to the 14th. This is the most spectacular event in Hong Kong. Aside from the traditional "ghost grappling competition", they also added a new "Yu Lan festival offerings competition for families" that everyone can participate in. In addition to explaining the history of Yulan through comics, there is also a thematic 3D photo shooting featuring Yulan on site. There is also an area serving traditional snacks and where you can experience traditional handcraft workshops that attracts many kids and people from abroad to take a look and experience it for themselves. There was a couple from France that stayed at the event for almost 3 hours and enjoyed the full experience of the mini flower card workshop. "I learned about this special holiday on the internet, so I decided to come take a look and was a really refreshing experience." They said that although France has similar festivals to commemorate ancestors, the atmosphere is very somber. Unlike the ones back home, there is music, food, and traditional craft here to enjoy. She said, “we were able to see an organized and large scaled festival to worship ancestors along with busy financial metropolis of Hong Kong." “This not only reflects the diversity of Chinese culture, but also allows more people to understand these traditional crafts and pass them on to future generations.” Hu Yansong, president of the event, said: “We don’t want to make the Yulan Festival so somber and scary that people won't want to come. Especially the children.” "We hope that through this event, we can convey to the younger generation that the meaning behind the Yulan festival is about filial piety and appreciation." He also stated that there were 24 teams in the "ghost grappling competition" of which we had a team from the community organization, and some schools so that students can participate as well. It is recognized that the Yulan festival was listed as part of "China Intangible Cultural Heritage" 2011.</div>

The "2016 Ullam Cultural Festival" organized by the Federation of Hong Kong Chiu Chow Community Organizations will be held at Victoria Park from 12th to the 14th. This will be the largest Ullam celebration held in Hong Kong. Other than the " Catching the Single" from the previous events, a new game of " Family Piling" was added for the whole family to enjoy.

A French couple stayed in the event venue for nearly 3 hours, and had a great experience with the mini floral card workshop. "I found this special festival on the net, and decided to come and have a look. Its really interesting." They expressed that though France have similar holidays to celebrate historical characters, the atmosphere is more somber unlike this place where there is music, food, and an opportunity to learn about the traditional arts. She said: "It is surprising to see an ancestral worshiping ceremony of such scale and organization in a busy financial metropolis such as Hong Kong." "This not only highlighted the diversity of Chinese culture, but also allowed more people to learn about these traditional handicraft and pass on this legacy." Wu Yim-chung, overall coordinator of this event, said, "We didn't want to have scary decorations for the Hungry Ghost Cultural Festival so that people, particularly little kids, dare not approach." "We hope that by providing a younger setting and decor for the event, youths will be able to learn that the Ullam Festival aims to communicate the virtue of filial piety and thanksgiving."

	<div class="source" id="152">尽管还没有被证实，但诸多消息源都表示，苹果2016年秋季发布会将在9月举行，iPhone7真要来了。 虽然苹果公司并未回应，但有关新iPhone的功能、配置已经陆续有消息放出，甚至网上连iPhone7“真机模型”图片都有了。 新一代iPhone可谓“万众瞩目”，火热、紧俏、有钱无货……如果你想第一时间购买到正品，一定要选择一个好渠道，比如说，苏宁。 这加剧了人们对于新手机的失望，“它加长了，却根本不能投射全息图像!这一代iPhone糟透了。” iPhone7像其他iPhone一样，出生之前就伴随着无数秘闻。 另外，还有多个消息源声称，新一代iPhone将取消3.5mm耳机接口，转而使用蓝牙连接和充电接口，这将为苹果增加第二个扬声器提供空间。 能佐证这一消息的另一证据是，早在2014年苹果就允许耳机厂商生产通过充电接口连接的耳机产品。 这些消息或真或假，答案直到苹果2016秋季发布会才能揭晓。 但这并不妨碍业内人士看好iPhone7的前景——许多人认为，iPhone7将很有可能成为苹果对iPhone系列的最后一次大幅升级。 虽然从不久前市场研究机构IDC公布的数据来看，iPhone的市场份额有所下滑。 其中，高盛将苹果的股票维持“买入”评级，而BMO的分析师则认为iPhone7将收获一份历史性的销售成绩。 同时博通公司的CEO Hock Tan也表示，苹果未来的营收增加将有可能超过20%，而这完全得益于iPhone7的推出。 有7%的受访者表示他们有购买iPhone7的打算，而两年前计划购买iPhone6的人数比例只有4%。 据了解，目前持有iPhone6或6Plus的用户群体有20%计划购买iPhone7，这是一个相当高的比例。 其次，有专家分析，大部分果粉都喜欢隔代更换自己的iPhone手机。 <span class="highlighted">据统计，在所有的iPhone用户中，有大约26%的用户已经2年没有更换手机了，也就是差不多有1.2亿的用户的iPhone已经用了2年。</span> 有媒体称，iPhone7生产期间，台湾遭遇数次地震，“台积电生产设施的受破坏程度超出想象，并有可能对初期的iPhone7供应产生影响。” 供需矛盾会影响普通用户，是时候选择一个好渠道，第一时间低价入手正品iPhone7。 据知情人士透露，近期，苏宁高层与苹果公司频频见面，目的就是为了准备充足的货源。 运营商已经与苏宁谈妥，可以预见的是，随着双方的深度合作，必然会为用户带来更低的价格和更贴心的服务。 “最低的价格，消费者可能‘一天只需7元钱，就能购买iPhone7’。” 充足的货源与多样的优惠，让购买iPhone7不再“压力山大”，而苏宁的物流，更是会把这种美好变成更直观的体验感。 也许，你半夜就会接到电话，“您好，苏宁易购，您的iPhone7到了。”</div>
	<div class="translation" id="152">Although it has yet to be proven, many information sources indicate that Apple will hold its 2016 Fall event in September. iPhone 7 is really on its way. Although Apple did not respond, news concerning the functions and configuration of the iPhone are being released gradually. Pictures of the "actual phone model" have even appeared on the Internet. The new iPhone could be considered a "public phenomenon". It's popular, sleek, and could not be acquired even if you have the money to pay for it. If you want to buy an original product, you must opt for a proper sales channel such as Suning. This heightened the people's sense of disappointment for the new cellphone. "It became longer, but couldn't project holographs! This iPhone release sucks." Like other iPhones, numerous anecdotes and secret information accompanied the iPhone 7 before its debut. Elsewhere, many sources of information also claimed that the 3.5mm headphone jack will be removed from the new iPhone to be replaced by bluetooth connection and the charging interface. This will give Apple room for adding a second speaker. Another piece of corroborative evidence is that as far back as 2014, Apple had already allowed headphone manufacturers to connect headphone products through the charging interface. The answer to such news, whether true or false, will only be revealed by Apple at the 2016 Fall launch event. This did not stop industry insiders from taking a positive view of the prospects of iPhone 7 however. Many believed that iPhone 7 could very well be the last time Apple would significantly upgrade the iPhone series. However, data recently published by IDC, a market intelligence firm, showed the market share of iPhone has decreased slightly. Goldman Sachs has rated Apple shares as something that can be "bought". BMO analysts believe that iPhone7 will establish a historical record in sales performance. Broadcom CEO Hock Tan also expressed that Apple is expected to achieve more than 20% growth in revenue. This figure can be completely attributed to the release of iPhone7. 7% of those interviewed said they intend to buy iPhone 7 compared to a mere 4% who planned to buy iPhone 6 two years ago. From information available, 20% of users currently holding an iPhone6 or 6Plus have plans for purchasing iPhone7. This proportion is quite substantial. Next, experts analyzed that most Apple fans like to replace their iPhone every other generation. <span class="highlighted">Statistics revealed that among iPhone users, approximately 26% of users have not changed their mobile phones in two years, i.e., the iPhones of about 120 million users have been used for two years.</span> Some media reported that Taiwan has been hit by several earthquakes during the iPhone7 production period. "Damages sustained by TSMC production facilities may have went beyond expectations, and that could have influenced initial supply for iPhone7." Supply and demand conflicts will influence normal users. It is time to select a proper channel and acquire an authentic iPhone7 early at a low price. Insider disclosure revealed that the upper management of Suning and Apple has met frequently in recent times for the purpose of preparing enough resources. Service operators have reached an agreement with Suning. It can be expected that with growing partnership between the two, users will be provided with lower prices and more dedicated services. " The lowest price. The customers might' only RMB 7 a day to get a iPhone7". Sufficient supply of goods and a variety of discounts, buyers of iPhone 7 will not be so stressed out, and Suning's logistics department will all the more turn this happiness into a more intuitive experience. Perhaps you will receive a phone call at midnight. "Hello, this is Suning.com. Your iPhone 7 has arrived."</div>
	<div class="translation" id="152">It has not yet been confirmed yet, but many sources have indicated that Apple's 2016 fall conference will be held in September. The iPhone 7 is really going to come out. Although Apple did not comment, information and specification of the new iPhone has been released and there are "actual" photos of the iPhone 7 on the web. The new generation of the iPhone is going to be slick, popular, and limited, thus if you want to be one of the first one to get a hold of it, be sure to know where to buy it from...like Suning. "This has led to further disappointment in the new phone. It is longer but can't even take videos. This generation of iPhone is terrible." Like the other iPhones, iPhone 7 had its share of secrets before being released. In addition, there are multiple sources claiming that the new generation of iPhone will not feature a 3.5mm headphone jack and use Bluetooth connectivity instead and will just have the charging port. This will provide space for Apple to add a second speaker. As evidence to backup this claim, Apple had developed earphones that would connect to the charging port back in 2014. Regardless of whether the rumors are true or not, we will only know for sure when it is announced in Apple's fall 2016 conference. However, this does not prevent the industry from looking at the potential specification of the iPhone 7 - many believe that the iPhone 7 will most likely be Apple's last major upgrade to the iPhone series. IDC, which is a market research institute recently released data that the market share of iPhone has declined. However, Goldman Sachs will maintain the "buy" rating for Apple's stock, and BMO analysts believe that iPhone7 will come together with a historic sales performance. Additionally, Broadcom’s CEO Hock Tan also stated that Apple’s future revenue growth may exceed 20%, all thanks to the launch of the iPhone 7. Seven percent of respondents said they had plans to purchase the iPhone 7, compared to only four percent who planned to purchase the iPhone 6 two years ago. It is understood that 20% of those currently using the iPhone 6 or 6 Plus plan to purchase the iPhone 7, which is a very high percentage. Also, experts analyzed that most of Apple consumers like to replace their iPhones every generation. <span class="highlighted">According to the data, about 26% of all iPhone users have not changed their phones for 2 years. Which means almost 120 million people have used the iPhone for 2 years.</span> Some media claimed that Taiwan faced several earthquakes during the production of iPhone 7 and, “The damage of TSMC's production facilities was bigger than expected and may affect the initial iPhone 7 supply.” The disparity between supply and demand will affect the average customers. It is time to choose a good place to buy an authentic iPhone 7 early at a lower price. According to informed sources, Suning executives met frequently with Apple in order to prepare enough stock. The company is already in discussion with Suning, and will inevitable provide a lower price and better service for consumers through a high-level of cooperation between the two parties. “At the lowest price, consumers may only need to pay 7 yuan a day to purchase the iPhone 7.” Plentiful stock and various services will make purchasing the iPhone less stressful. Through Suning's logistics, will further lead to a heightened buying experience. You may perhaps get a call in the middle of a night which will say "Hi this is Suning.com. Your iPhone 7 is here."</div>
	<div class="translation" id="152">Although it hasn't been confirmed, numerous sources have said Apple's fall 2016 launch will take place in September, and the iPhone 7 is really coming.

The next generation of iPhones is "eye-catching", hot, hot, rich and out of stock... If you want to buy the real thing for the first time, make sure you choose a good channel, say, Suning. This added to the frustration over the new phone, "It lengthens, but it doesn't project a hologram at all! This generation of iPhones sucks." The iPhone 7, like other iPhones, has been accompanied by countless secrets before it was born. Also, multiple sources have claimed that the new iPhone will eliminate the 3.5mm headphone jack and instead use a Bluetooth connection and charging jack, which would give Apple room to add a second speaker. Another piece of evidence to back up the news is that back in 2014 Apple allowed headphone makers to make headphone products that were connected through a charging interface. The news is either true or false, and the answer won't be revealed until Apple's autumn 2016 launch. But that doesn't detract from the industry's bullish outlook for the iPhone 7 - which many believe will most likely be Apple's last major upgrade to the iPhone family. Though the iPhone's market share has fallen, according to data released recently by market research firm IDC. Among them, Goldman Sachs maintained a "buy" rating on Apple's stock, while BMO analysts said the iPhone 7 would reap a historic sales performance. At the same time, Hock Tan, CEO of Broadcom, said it was likely that Apple would increase revenue by more than 20 percent in the future, thanks entirely to the launch of the iPhone 7. Seven percent of respondents said they planned to buy the iPhone 7, compared with just four percent two years ago. It is understood that 20 per cent of the current group of users who hold the iPhone 6 or 6Plus plan to buy the iPhone 7, which is a fairly high percentage.

Contradictions between supply and demand will affect ordinary users, it is time to choose a good channel, the first time low prices to start the genuine iPhone 7. According to people familiar with the matter, recently, Suning executives have been meeting with Apple frequently in order to prepare an adequate supply. The operator has already negotiated with Suning, and predictably, with the deep cooperation between the two sides, it is bound to bring lower prices and more intimate services to users. "At the lowest price, consumers might be able to buy an iPhone 7 for as little as $7 a day," he said. Sufficient supply and a variety of concessions, so that the purchase of the iPhone 7 is no longer "pressure mountain," and Suning's logistics, is to turn this beautiful into a more intuitive experience. Maybe you'll get a call in the middle of the night saying, "Hello, Suning EasyJet, your iPhone 7 is here."</div>

	<div class="source" id="153">格雷西亚是一只萌萌的雌性巨嘴鸟，浑身散发着热带雨林的气息。 在中美洲国家哥斯达黎加，巨嘴鸟格雷西亚和它的故事早已家喻户晓。 8月10日的新闻发布会上，术后康复的格雷西亚终于亮相，向人们展示它崭新的3D打印塑料鸟喙。 这只一年半前被人折断上喙、奄奄一息的巨嘴鸟，如今终于重获新生。 这一天不仅宣告着它已100%恢复健康，更是它搬进豪华鸟舍、与关心它的人类朋友们见面的日子。 初进新家的格雷西亚稍显腼腆，但不多时就变得活泼起来，在水盆里打滚嬉闹，用新喙吃葡萄。 为了提醒人们它曾经遭受的伤害，技术人员没有给它的新喙上色，而是保留了3D打印材料原有的白色。 鸟喙外是一层薄薄的角质鞘，里面中空，只有一些细细的骨质支撑杆交错排列。 虽然有这种内部加固成份，巨嘴鸟的喙还是脆弱，受到伤害时会破碎。 动物救助中心、鸟类学家和一家美国3D打印公司通力合作，为格雷西亚制作了好几个“试验喙”，终于造出最适合它的“完美喙”。 如今格雷西亚已能熟练使用新喙喝水、吃东西，甚至啄起细小谷粒。 “最终成品的设计花了大约2个月，打印出来只需4、5个小时。” “3D打印并不是未来技术，它已经实实在在走进了你我的生活。”美国SG3D打印公司董事长托马斯·朗格在接受新华国际记者采访时说。 <span class="highlighted">2015年1月，在哥斯达黎加中部阿拉胡埃拉省格雷西亚的一个农场，浑身是血的巨嘴鸟格雷西亚被人发现。</span> 当时它的上喙被一伙年轻人残忍折断，它完全无法进食，生命垂危。 格雷西亚的惨状经媒体报道后，在哥斯达黎加内外引起如潮的反对虐待动物呼声。 人们要求设立更为严格的动物保护法、加大对虐待者的惩罚力度。 人们自发前来，尽最大努力帮助格雷西亚尽可能恢复受伤前的生活。 甚至3D打印技术发明人查克·赫尔也参与到格雷西亚上喙的设计中来。 “格雷西亚的情况很特殊，它的上喙剩余部分不足1厘米，所以给安装新喙带来许多困难。” “我们先对格雷西亚扫描，然后设计、制作出一个稍长于它上喙剩余部分的延长假体，用粘胶固定在它的上喙上。” “这样可以减少对格雷西亚造成进一步侵入性伤害。”朗格对新华国际记者说。 在安装假体之前，工作人员每天都要为格雷西亚清理断喙，以防感染。 远在千里之外，巨嘴鸟格雷西亚的故事感动了著名纪录片导演葆拉·埃雷迪亚和探索新闻频道制片人约翰·霍夫曼。 他们记录下格雷西亚安装新喙过程中的点点滴滴，录制了一部纪录片《巨嘴鸟之国》，已于本月在动物星球频道上播放。 纪录片《巨嘴鸟之国》向人们展示，一只小小的巨嘴鸟是如何让一个国家为之改变、如何让国民都参与到反对虐待动物当中来。</div>
	<div class="translation" id="153">Grecia is an adorable female toucan that exudes a tropical feel. The story of Grecia the toucan has been known early on in the Central American country of Costa Rica. In the press release on August 30th, Grecia who recovered from the surgery showed off her new prosthetic 3D printed beak to the public. The toucan whose beak was hacked off by humans and was dying a year and half ago is now reborn. This day not only confirms that she is 100% healthy, but also is a day when she will be relocated to a luxurious cage and a day for those who care about her to be able to see her. Grecia was a bit shy after moving to her new home but became more lively as she played in the water and ate grapes with her new beak. The engineering specialist did not newly paint the 3D printed beak to serve as a reminder to people of what she went through, thus leaving it in the original white color of the 3D printing material. The outer layer of the beak features a thin wall of keratin, and the inside is generally hollow and is only supported by several thin bone struts. Despite the interior being reinforced, the toucan's beak is still frail and can break when damaged. With the collaboration with the animal rescue center, bird specialists, and a US 3D printing company, the group was able to create several "trial versions" to identify and finally create "the perfect one". Grecia can now skillfully use her new beak to drink water, eat, and even pick up small grains. "The design of the final product took around 2 months and the printing only took 4-5 hours." The president of SG3D Printing, Thomas Lange explained to Xinhua International during an interview that, "3D printing is not a technology of the future but has already stepped in to our lives". <span class="highlighted">In January 2015, a bloodied toucan (Grecia) was found on a farm in Grecia, Alajuela Province located in central Costa Rica.</span> The beak was brutally hacked off by a group of youngsters. She could not eat at all and was in critical condition. After the media covered the story of Grecia's tragic situation, it triggered a wave of opposition on animal cruelty in and outside of Costa Rica. People have since called out for a stricter animal protection law and for harsher penalties for animal abuse. People proactively came together to do their best to help Grecia recover and regain her life before being injured. Chuck Hall who is the inventor of 3D printing was also involved in the design of Grecia's beak. "Grecia's situation was a very special one as there was less than 1 cm of the upper jaw left, which caused many difficulties in attaching the beak." "We first scanned Grecia then designed an extended cap that was a bit longer than the remnant beak, then glued the prosthetic beak". Lange told the reporters of Xinhua International that "By doing so, we can prevent further injury for Grecia". Before installing the prosthetic beak, the staff had to keep Grecia clean everyday to prevent infections. The story of Grecia the toucan travelled the distance and touched John Hoffman who is a producer at Discovery News Channel and Paul Heredia who is a famous documentary director. They filmed bits and pieces of the installation of Grecia's new beak to make a documentary called "Toucan Nation" which was aired on Animal Planet this month. The documentary "Toucan Nation" shows how a small Toucan inspired a nation to make changes and citizens to get involved to stop animal cruelty.</div>
	<div class="translation" id="153">Gracia is a cute female toucan with the scent of the jungle about her. In the Central American country of Costa Rica, the toucan Gracia and its story are extremely well-known. The August 10 press conference finally revealed Gracia after recovering from the operation, displaying its brand new 3D-printed plastic beak. This toucan whose upper beak was broken by someone, and which was on the brink of death, has now finally received a new lease of life. This is the day that the bird has reached 100% recovery and the day when it could be moved to a luxurious bird house and meet its human friends who have been caring for it. Gracia appears to be rather shy after moving to her new home, but quickly revealed her lively side, playing in the pool of water and using her new beak to eat grapes. To remind people of the abuse it once suffered, the technicians did not color its new beak, but kept it white, the original color of the 3D printing material. The external layer of the beak is a thin keratin sheath. The beak is hollow and only reinforced by thin, criss-crossing supporting struts of bone. Although reinforced internally, the toucan's beak is still fragile, and will crack when it is harmed. The animal aid center, an ornithologist, and a 3D printing company from the United States are working together, making several "experimental beaks" for Gracia before creating the "perfect beak" that best suits the bird. Now Gracia has become proficient in using her beak to drink, eat, and even pick up fine seed grains. "The design of the final product took about two months; printing took just four to five hours." "3D printing is not for next generation. It has become part of our life." Thomas Lange, President of SG3D told the  Xinhua News Agency. <span class="highlighted">On January 2015, Gracia the toucan was found, bleeding from its mouth, by a person in a farm at Gracia, Alajuela Province in central Costa Rica.</span> At the time, its upper beak was cruelly broken by a group of youths. It could not eat and was dying. Once reported in mass media, Gracia's sad state initiated a wave of outcry against animal abuse in and outside Costa Rica. The public requested more rigorous animal protection laws to be established, and punishment for abusers to be stepped out. People came forward voluntarily, and did the best they could to help Grecia regain its life prior to the injury. Even Chuck Hull, the inventor of 3D printing technology, also contributed towards the design of Gracia's upper beak. "Gracia's condition is quite unique. Less than 1 cm of its upper beak has remained, making it difficult to install a new beak." "We first scanned Gracia and then designed and manufactured an extended prosthetic that is slightly longer than its remaining upper beak. The prosthetic is then glued to its upper beak." "This will help reduce further invasive injury on Grecia," Lange told a XInhua international news reporter. Prior to installing the prosthetics, workers cleaned the broken beak for Gracia everyday to prevent infections. Thousands of miles away, the story of Gracia the toucan has moved renowned documentary filmmaker Paula Heredia and investigative journalist John Hoffman. Toucan Nation is a documentary that recorded in detail the process of fitting a new beak for Grecia, which was broadcast on Animal Planet this month. The documentary Toucan Nation showed how a small toucan bird could change a country and encourage every citizen to participate in the movement against animal abuse.</div>
	<div class="translation" id="153">Gracia is a budding female toucan with the scent of a tropical rainforest. In the Central American country of Costa Rica, the toucan Gracia and its story have long been a household name. At a press conference on August 10, Gracia, who is recovering from surgery, finally appeared to show off her brand-new, 3D printed plastic beak. The dying toucan, which had its beak snapped off a year and a half ago, has been given a new lease of life. This day heralds not only its 100 per cent return to health, but also its move into the luxurious aviary and its meeting with human friends who care about it. Gracia, who had just entered her new home, was a little shy, but soon became active, wallowing in the basin and eating the grapes with her new beak. To remind people of the damage it has suffered, instead of painting its new beak, technicians have kept the original white of the 3D printing material. The beak is covered with a thin, horny sheath that is hollow inside, with only a few thin, bone-supporting poles interlaced. Despite this internal reinforcement, the toucan's beak is still fragile and will break when it is damaged. The Animal Rescue Center, ornithologists and an American 3D printing company worked together to create several "experimental beaks" for Gracia, finally creating the "perfect beak" for her. Gracia is now adept at using her new beak to drink, eat and even pick up tiny grains. "The final product took about two months to design and only four or five hours to print." "3D printing is not the technology of the future, it has really come into your life and mine," Thomas Langer, chairman of SG3D printing company, told Xinhua International. <span class="highlighted">Gracia, a toucan covered in blood, was discovered on a farm in Gracia, in the central Alajuela province of Costa Rica, in January 2015.</span> At that time, its beak was brutally broken by a group of young people, it was completely unable to eat, life-threatening. The tragedy in Gracia has caused a flurry of calls against animal cruelty in and around Costa Rica after media reports. There have been calls for stricter animal protection laws and greater penalties for abusers. People came spontaneously and did their best to help Gracia get back to life as much as possible before the injury. Even Chuck Hull, the inventor of 3D printing technology, was involved in the design of Gracia's upper beak. "The case of Gracia is unique in that the remaining part of its upper beak is less than one centimetre, which makes it difficult to install a new beak," he said. "We scanned Gracia and then designed and made an extended prosthesis that was slightly longer than the rest of her upper beak. "This will reduce further invasive damage to Gracia," Langer told Xinhua International. Before installing the prosthesis, staff had to clean up Gracia's beak every day to prevent infection. Thousands of miles away, the story of Toucan Gracia moved famous documentary filmmaker Paula Heredia and Discovery News producer John Hoffman. They chronicled the installation of Gracia's new beak and recorded a documentary, "Land of the Toucans," which was shown on Animal Planet this month. The documentary "Land of Toucans" shows how a tiny toucan can make a country change for itself, and how it can involve its citizens in the fight against animal cruelty.</div>

Zhao Xiuping said: At present, enterprises have invested 400 million in environmental protection, a huge amount on the surface, but the concept of business management, social benefits have a great impact on the enterprise innovation and management has also opened up space. On the same day, Qingdao Sifang Xinchengzhizhuo Bus Accessories Co., Ltd. has also come to the annual output of 4,200 high-speed rail and EMU interior accessories projects to purchase emission rights. The project belongs to the mechanical processing enterprises, the application for the initial emission of chemical oxygen demand (COD) 0.514 tons / year, ammonia nitrogen (NOX) 0.052 tons / year. Air pollutant emission rights paid use and trade for the city's electricity, thermal production and supply of key industrial enterprises. Existing units that have obtained an EIA prior to January 1, 2016, will not be charged a toll fee for the time being. "Paid access to emission permits is not the same as access to the power of illegal discharge of pollutants, and can not be arbitrarily discharged pollutants." Han Hongyan, deputy director of Qingdao Municipal Environmental Protection Bureau, said that if illegal discharge, excessive discharge should still be punished in accordance with the relevant regulations, it is impossible to allow illegal enterprises through the purchase of pollution rights to avoid punishment. In other words, through legal means to crack down on environmental violations, and severely punish enterprises for excessive pollution, so as to protect the environment and protect public health. Now enterprises for their own interests, improve the enthusiasm of pollution control, cherish the limited emission rights, reducing the emission of pollutants. Driven by the economic benefits, reducing the emission of pollutants will change from the government's compulsory behavior to the enterprise's conscious market behavior, so as to truly achieve the goal of protecting the environment, protecting nature and protecting public health. Emission right, also known as "emission right", is the right to discharge pollutants, which refers to the right of the emitter to discharge pollutants into the environment within the quota allocated by the government according to law. This right is essentially the right of the polluter to possess, use and benefit from the environmental capacity resources. Next, under the premise that the total amount of pollutants discharged does not exceed the permitted amount, the amount of pollutants discharged is adjusted by means of currency exchange between the internal sources of pollution. Since the emission trading was put forward by American economist Dales in 1968, it has been applied to the management of air and river pollution sources in the United States since the 1970s. China began to carry out pilot projects in 2007, and 14 provinces (autonomous regions and municipalities), including Zhejiang and Jiangsu, have been fully implemented.</div>
	<div class="translation" id="157">Qingdao is the 12th and the first pilot city in Shandong Province to utilize a carbon trading scheme. On the 11th, many companies came to the Qingdao's Emission Trading Center to submit their carbon trading application and will pay the permit fees once it is processed. The first trading done represents that the carbon emission trading pilot program has officially started, and will be the first in the province to introduce the emission trading scheme at the city-level. <span class="highlighted">On the morning of the 11th, Zhao Xiuping, the president of Qingdao Shuangtao Jingxi Chemical Industry (Group) Limited Company, came to the Qingdao Emissions Trading Center to submit an application to purchase an emission permit.</span> The same company had a plant in Qingdao's old town but was shut down last year and relocated to Pingdu for environmental concerns. After Zhao Xiuping submitted the construction and environmental assessment permit application, the Qingdao Emissions Trading Center started to do a preliminary review of the submitted application. The estimated initial emission fee is approximately 641,200 yuan according to the collection standards set by Qingdao Pricing Administration. The staff will process and verify it within 7 business days. The first trading done represents that the carbon emission trading pilot program has officially started, and will be the first in the province to introduce the emission trading scheme at the city-level. Zhao Xiuping mentioned that he has invested RMB 400 million on corporate environmental responsibility. Despite being a large amount of money put into this, it greatly impacts the company's philosophy, social responsibility, and also opens up a new level of innovation management. On the same day, Qingdao Sifang Xincheng Zhizhuo Coach Parts Co., Ltd. also came to purchase emission permits for their annual production of 4,200 pieces of high-speed rail and EMU (Electrical Multiple Unit) interior parts. This project was for the machining companies, with initial emission amount of 0.514 ton/yr of COD, and 0.052 ton/yr of NOX on their application. The carbon emission trading is an important business to support electricity and heat for the city. The carbon credits obtained from EIA before January 1, 2016 will not be charged with the usage fee for the time being. "Purchasing an emission permit does not grant permission to freely discharge illegal pollutants." Han Hongyan, the Deputy Director of the Environmental Protection Bureau of Qingdao stated the those who discharge illegal pollutants and excessive pollutants will still be punished according to the regulation; those discharging illegal discharge of pollutants and excessive discharge of pollutants will still have to be punished in accordance with relevant regulations, and companies will not be able to purchase emission permits to avoid punishment for illegal or excessive discharges. Basically, through legal measures and being stringent on environmental violations and to punish companies for excessive discharges, we will be able to protect the environment and the health of the public. Companies have now put their focus on managing emissions for their own benefit and appreciate limiting the emission amount which has lead to a reduction of pollutants being discharged. With the economic benefits being a factor, the government's bold action has lead to company's to react to take action on reducing emissions. This will all lead to protecting the environment, nature, and the health of the public. The right to emit pollutants, also known as “emissions permit”. It refers to the right of emitters to discharge pollutants to the environment within the limits allocated by the government. This type of right limits the footprint of the polluters in the environment and a right to gain revenue. The next step, assuming that the discharged pollutant does not exceed the limit is to control the emission amount  through carbon emission trading. Emissions trading was proposed by American economist John Dales back in 1968. Since the 1970s in the 20th Century, the United States has applied it to control pollution in the atmosphere and river. China has been doing trials since 2007, and has implemented it in 14 provinces (in regions and cities) including Zhejiang and Jiangsu.</div>
	<div class="translation" id="157">Qingdao is the 12th city in the nation and the first in Shandong Province to implement the pilot program for paying for the use and trading of emissions rights. On the 11th, many companies submitted emission rights purchase applications at the Qingdao Emissions Trading Center. Those who successfully applied for the rights will start paying a usage fee. The imminent completion of this first trade also marks the official launch of the pilot program for the trading of emission rights in Qingdao. This will also be the first emission rights trade in the Province as well as the first city-level  emission rights trade in the nation. <span class="highlighted">In the morning of the 11th, Zhao Xiuping, general manager of Qingdao Shuangtao Jingxi Chemical Industry (Group) came to the Qingdao City Emissions Trading Center to submit an application to purchase emission rights.</span> This corporation, situated in the factory area of Old Town of Qingdao, stopped its production lines at the end of last year, and was moved, using environment-friendly means, to a new plant area in Pingdu. Zhao Xiuping submitted the application form, environmental impact report, and other materials for the construction project. The Qingdao City Emissions Reserve and Trading Service Center began preliminary reviews of the application materials. According to the collection criteria determined by Qingdao's pricing, finance and other departments, the  initial usage fee for emissions rights is currently estimated at approximately RMB641,200. Staff will complete checking and ratification within seven working days. The first transaction, which will be completed soon, also marks the formal initiation of the Qingdao Emissions Trading Pilot Project. This will also be the first emissions trading in the province and the first city-level emissions trading in the entire country. Zhao Xiuping said, "Presently, enterprises have invested RMB400 million in environmental protection. On the surface, this seems an enormous amount, but it has a profound impact on both the operational and management philosophy of enterprises as well as social benefit, and has provided room for innovative management by enterprises. On that day, Qingdao Sifang Xincheng Zhizhuo Coach Components Co., Ltd. also came to apply for and purchase emission rights for the project to produce 4,200 pieces of interior accessories and components for high speed train and electric multiple units. This project is initiated by a mechanical processing company. The company is applying for an initial emissions as chemical oxygen demand (COD) of 0.514 tons/year and ammonia nitrogen (NOX) of 0.052 tons/year. Paying for the use and trading of air pollutant emissions rights is for the city's key power and heat production and supply industrial enterprises. Existing polluting companies that have received a bad rating prior to January 1, 2016 will be temporarily exempt from the usage fee. "Paying for emission rights does not mean gaining the right to generate illegal emissions. The payer may not emit waste as they like." Deputy Director Han Hongyan of the Qingdao Environmental Protection Bureau explained that illegal emissions or emissions that exceed specified limits shall be subject to penalties according to relevant laws. Violating companies will not be able to purchase emission rights to avoid punishments. In another word, we should fight against environmental offense and  excessive discharge by enterprises with serious legal action to protect our environment and public health. Enterprises are now more enthusiastic about pollution treatment because of their own interests; limited emission rights are valued, and emission of pollutants has decreased. Driven by economic interest, reducing emission of pollutants will shift from mandatory acts imposed by the government to conscious corporate market behavior. Thus, the goal of protecting the environment and nature as well as ensuring public health will be achieved. The right to discharge pollutants, or "emission rights", are a right to emit pollutants, i.e., polluters, within a quota allocated by the government, enjoy the right to discharge pollutants into the environment according to the law. This right is in essence, the right polluters have on the ownership, use and profit of existing resources in the environment. In the next step, under the pretext of keeping total emissions within the allowable emission volume, various internal sources of pollution shall use currency exchange to modulate emissions. Emissions trading was first proposed by the US economist Dales in 1968. In the 1970s, the US made use of this to manage sources of atmospheric and river pollution. Pilot programs were initiated since 2007. Currently, the program is being fully implemented at Zhejiang, Jiangsu, and other 14 provinces (in districts and cities).</div>

Compared to the provisions stipulated in the national version, the scope of public services and conveniences provided by some regions has been extended. These regions have added the convenience of allowing children who meet relevant terms and conditions to take part in college entrance exams. Moreover, Beijing and many other cities decided to expand public services progressively with regular public announcement. For instance, as proposed by Fujian, an announcement should be made to the public at least once every three years as regards the scope of public services and conveniences enjoyed by persons holding residence permits. The Interim Regulation on Residence Permits stipulate that an individual who meets the criteria for applying for a residence permit, the police department shall, within 15 days after accepting the application, prepare and issue the residence permit.

On the 11th, many companies submitted emission rights purchase applications at the Qingdao Emissions Trading Center. Those who successfully applied for the rights will start paying a usage fee. The imminent completion of this first trade also marks the official launch of the pilot program for the trading of emission rights in Qingdao. This will also be the first emission rights trade in the Province as well as the first city-level  emission rights trade in the nation. In the morning of the 11th, Zhao Xiuping, general manager of Qingdao Shuangtao Jingxi Chemical Industry (Group) came to the Qingdao City Emissions Trading Center to submit an application to purchase emission rights. This corporation, situated in the factory area of Old Town of Qingdao, stopped its production lines at the end of last year, and was moved, using environment-friendly means, to a new plant area in Pingdu. Zhao Xiuping submitted the application form, environmental impact report, and other materials for the construction project. The Qingdao City Emissions Reserve and Trading Service Center began preliminary reviews of the application materials. <span class="highlighted">According to the collection criteria determined by Qingdao's pricing, finance and other departments, the  initial usage fee for emissions rights is currently estimated at approximately RMB641,200. Staff will complete checking and ratification within seven working days.</span> The first transaction, which will be completed soon, also marks the formal initiation of the Qingdao Emissions Trading Pilot Project. This will also be the first emissions trading in the province and the first city-level emissions trading in the entire country. Zhao Xiuping said, "Presently, enterprises have invested RMB400 million in environmental protection. On the surface, this seems an enormous amount, but it has a profound impact on both the operational and management philosophy of enterprises as well as social benefit, and has provided room for innovative management by enterprises. On that day, Qingdao Sifang Xincheng Zhizhuo Coach Components Co., Ltd. also came to apply for and purchase emission rights for the project to produce 4,200 pieces of interior accessories and components for high speed train and electric multiple units. This project is initiated by a mechanical processing company. The company is applying for an initial emissions as chemical oxygen demand (COD) of 0.514 tons/year and ammonia nitrogen (NOX) of 0.052 tons/year. Paying for the use and trading of air pollutant emissions rights is for the city's key power and heat production and supply industrial enterprises. Existing polluting companies that have received a bad rating prior to January 1, 2016 will be temporarily exempt from the usage fee. "Paying for emission rights does not mean gaining the right to generate illegal emissions. The payer may not emit waste as they like." Deputy Director Han Hongyan of the Qingdao Environmental Protection Bureau explained that illegal emissions or emissions that exceed specified limits shall be subject to penalties according to relevant laws. Violating companies will not be able to purchase emission rights to avoid punishments. In another word, we should fight against environmental offense and  excessive discharge by enterprises with serious legal action to protect our environment and public health. Enterprises are now more enthusiastic about pollution treatment because of their own interests; limited emission rights are valued, and emission of pollutants has decreased. Driven by economic interest, reducing emission of pollutants will shift from mandatory acts imposed by the government to conscious corporate market behavior. Thus, the goal of protecting the environment and nature as well as ensuring public health will be achieved. The right to discharge pollutants, or "emission rights", are a right to emit pollutants, i.e., polluters, within a quota allocated by the government, enjoy the right to discharge pollutants into the environment according to the law. This right is in essence, the right polluters have on the ownership, use and profit of existing resources in the environment. In the next step, under the pretext of keeping total emissions within the allowable emission volume, various internal sources of pollution shall use currency exchange to modulate emissions. Emissions trading was first proposed by the US economist Dales in 1968. In the 1970s, the US made use of this to manage sources of atmospheric and river pollution. Pilot programs were initiated since 2007. Currently, the program is being fully implemented at Zhejiang, Jiangsu, and other 14 provinces (in districts and cities).</div>

On the 11th, many companies came to the Qingdao's Emission Trading Center to submit their carbon trading application and will pay the permit fees once it is processed. The first trading done represents that the carbon emission trading pilot program has officially started, and will be the first in the province to introduce the emission trading scheme at the city-level. On the morning of the 11th, Zhao Xiuping, the president of Qingdao Shuangtao Jingxi Chemical Industry (Group) Limited Company, came to the Qingdao Emissions Trading Center to submit an application to purchase an emission permit. The same company had a plant in Qingdao's old town but was shut down last year and relocated to Pingdu for environmental concerns. After Zhao Xiuping submitted the construction and environmental assessment permit application, the Qingdao Emissions Trading Center started to do a preliminary review of the submitted application. <span class="highlighted">The estimated initial emission fee is approximately 641,200 yuan according to the collection standards set by Qingdao Pricing Administration.

Zhao Xiuping mentioned that he has invested RMB 400 million on corporate environmental responsibility. Despite being a large amount of money put into this, it greatly impacts the company's philosophy, social responsibility, and also opens up a new level of innovation management. On the same day, Qingdao Sifang Xincheng Zhizhuo Coach Parts Co., Ltd. also came to purchase emission permits for their annual production of 4,200 pieces of high-speed rail and EMU (Electrical Multiple Unit) interior parts. This project was for the machining companies, with initial emission amount of 0.514 ton/yr of COD, and 0.052 ton/yr of NOX on their application. The carbon emission trading is an important business to support electricity and heat for the city. The carbon credits obtained from EIA before January 1, 2016 will not be charged with the usage fee for the time being. "Purchasing an emission permit does not grant permission to freely discharge illegal pollutants." Han Hongyan, the Deputy Director of the Environmental Protection Bureau of Qingdao stated the those who discharge illegal pollutants and excessive pollutants will still be punished according to the regulation; those discharging illegal discharge of pollutants and excessive discharge of pollutants will still have to be punished in accordance with relevant regulations, and companies will not be able to purchase emission permits to avoid punishment for illegal or excessive discharges. Basically, through legal measures and being stringent on environmental violations and to punish companies for excessive discharges, we will be able to protect the environment and the health of the public. Companies have now put their focus on managing emissions for their own benefit and appreciate limiting the emission amount which has lead to a reduction of pollutants being discharged. With the economic benefits being a factor, the government's bold action has lead to company's to react to take action on reducing emissions. This will all lead to protecting the environment, nature, and the health of the public. The right to emit pollutants, also known as “emissions permit”. It refers to the right of emitters to discharge pollutants to the environment within the limits allocated by the government. This type of right limits the footprint of the polluters in the environment and a right to gain revenue. The next step, assuming that the discharged pollutant does not exceed the limit is to control the emission amount  through carbon emission trading. Emissions trading was proposed by American economist John Dales back in 1968. Since the 1970s in the 20th Century, the United States has applied it to control pollution in the atmosphere and river. China has been doing trials since 2007, and has implemented it in 14 provinces (in regions and cities) including Zhejiang and Jiangsu.</div>

Zhao Xiuping said: At present, enterprises have invested 400 million in environmental protection, a huge amount on the surface, but the concept of business management, social benefits have a great impact on the enterprise innovation and management has also opened up space. On the same day, Qingdao Sifang Xinchengzhizhuo Bus Accessories Co., Ltd. has also come to the annual output of 4,200 high-speed rail and EMU interior accessories projects to purchase emission rights. The project belongs to the mechanical processing enterprises, the application for the initial emission of chemical oxygen demand (COD) 0.514 tons / year, ammonia nitrogen (NOX) 0.052 tons / year. Air pollutant emission rights paid use and trade for the city's electricity, thermal production and supply of key industrial enterprises. Existing units that have obtained an EIA prior to January 1, 2016, will not be charged a toll fee for the time being. "Paid access to emission permits is not the same as access to the power of illegal discharge of pollutants, and can not be arbitrarily discharged pollutants." Han Hongyan, deputy director of Qingdao Municipal Environmental Protection Bureau, said that if illegal discharge, excessive discharge should still be punished in accordance with the relevant regulations, it is impossible to allow illegal enterprises through the purchase of pollution rights to avoid punishment. In other words, through legal means to crack down on environmental violations, and severely punish enterprises for excessive pollution, so as to protect the environment and protect public health. Now enterprises for their own interests, improve the enthusiasm of pollution control, cherish the limited emission rights, reducing the emission of pollutants. Driven by the economic benefits, reducing the emission of pollutants will change from the government's compulsory behavior to the enterprise's conscious market behavior, so as to truly achieve the goal of protecting the environment, protecting nature and protecting public health. Emission right, also known as "emission right", is the right to discharge pollutants, which refers to the right of the emitter to discharge pollutants into the environment within the quota allocated by the government according to law. This right is essentially the right of the polluter to possess, use and benefit from the environmental capacity resources. Next, under the premise that the total amount of pollutants discharged does not exceed the permitted amount, the amount of pollutants discharged is adjusted by means of currency exchange between the internal sources of pollution. Since the emission trading was put forward by American economist Dales in 1968, it has been applied to the management of air and river pollution sources in the United States since the 1970s. China began to carry out pilot projects in 2007, and 14 provinces (autonomous regions and municipalities), including Zhejiang and Jiangsu, have been fully implemented.</div>

Currently, at least 28 provinces in the country have clarified their subsidy disbursement criteria, but the disbursement criteria differs among provinces. In Chongqing, high-temperature subsidy is received based on subsidy for high-temperature working days. At temperatures equal or more than 35℃ and less than 37℃, each person shall be given a fee of not less than RMB10 per day. At temperatures higher than 37℃, each person shall be given a fee of not less than RMB15 per day. Workers working at above a temperature of 40℃ can receive a monthly subsidy of up to 20 RMB per day (this does not apply to a worker who is already provided with a high temperature operation subsidy according to law). According to this criteria, Kaizhou, which experienced the most number of high-temperature days last month would receive RMB330, while Chengkou which experienced the least number of days would received RMB80. As the highest temperature in Youyang did not exceed the high temperature benchmark, it did not receive any high-temperature subsidy. In the past, many companies often use cooling and refreshing beverages to offset the high temperature subsidy. The city administration of work safety, however, expressed that this act is not compliant to the current laws. Employers may not deduct or reduce the salary of laborers if work has to be suspended or work time reduced due to high temperatures. The municipal human resources and social security bureau said that workers who worked under high temperatures without receiving high temperature allowance may fight for their legal rights by way of the labor dispute mediation mechanism, or call 12333 to file a complaint. In case employer refuse to pay high-temperature allowance, employee is entitled to complain to the local administrative authority of HR and social security at the county level. <span class="highlighted">Also, since the high temperature subsidy is considered part of the salary and not a benefit, it is included in total salary and subject to the personal income tax.</span> High temperature subsidies are not included considered part of the minimum wage and must be issued in the form of cash.

	<div class="translation" id="168">According to the Chongqing Meteorological Bureau portal to the high temperature of the counties statistics, in addition to Youyang, the rest of the city can receive different degrees of high temperature allowance. At least 28 provinces across the country have now clarified the criteria for the payment of allowances, although the criteria are not the same in the provinces and municipalities, while Chongqing receives a high-temperature allowance in the form of a high-temperature working day allowance. If the temperature is above 35 ° C and below 37 ° C, the standard is not less than 10 yuan per person per day, and if the temperature is above 37 ° C, the standard is not less than 15 yuan per person per day. High temperature workers above 40 ℃ are entitled to a monthly allowance of up to 20 yuan / day (except for those workers who have already enjoyed the post allowance for high temperature operation in accordance with the law). According to this standard, last month, the highest number of days of hot weather in Kaizhou can receive 330 yuan, the number of days the least Chengkou is 80 yuan, and Youyang the highest temperature due to not meet the high temperature standards, so there is no high temperature allowance. In the past, many units would offset the high temperature allowance with refreshing drinks. The City Safety Supervision Bureau said that this practice was not in line with the current practice. The employing units shall not deduct or reduce the wages of the workers if they stop working or shorten their working hours due to the hot weather. The city's social service bureau said employees who have not received a high temperature allowance for working in high temperatures can fight for their legitimate rights and interests through the labor dispute mediation agency where the business is located, or call 12333 to lodge a complaint. If an employing unit refuses to pay a high-temperature allowance, the worker may file a complaint with the department in charge of human resources and social security at or above the county level in the place where the employee is employed. <span class="highlighted">At the same time, since the high temperature allowance is part of the salary and not a benefit, it is included in the total salary and deducted from the tax.</span> The high temperature allowance is therefore not covered by the minimum wage and must be paid in cash and cannot be substituted in kind, such as beverages.</div>
	<div class="translation" id="168">According to statistics of the Chongqing Municipal Meteorological Bureau portal on the high-temperature weather in various districts and counties except Fuyang, the rest of the city may have a deviance on the high temperature. Currently, there are at least 28 provinces in China that have clearly defined the standards for the subsidy. However, the standards issued by provinces and cities are not the same. Chongqing, on one other hand, receives heat allowances in the form of heat allowances on weekdays. If the temperature is 35°C to 37°C , a rate of not less than 10 yuan per person per day; if it exceeds 37°C, the rate shall not be less than 15 yuan per person per day. Workers working in high temperature environment above 40°C can receive up to 20 yuan per day per month (except for laborers who already receive the heat allowance according to law). According to this standard, Kaizhou, had the most days of high-temperature weather last month, and was able to receive 330 yuan, and Chengkou had the least number of days which equated to 80 yuan. The highest temperature recorded in Puyang did not reach the high temperature standard, so there was no heat allowance. In the past, many would give cold drinks instead of heat allowances. The City Work Safety Administration stated that such practices are not in line with current regulations. The employer may not deduct or reduce the wages of workers due to the stoppage of work due to high temperature and reduce working hours. The Municipal Bureau of Human Resources and Social Affairs stated that when an employee faces a situation where a the work environment is considered high-temperature but does not receive a heat allowance, he or she can seek legal rights through the labor dispute mediation agency where the company is located, or call 12333 to file a complaint. Where a company refuses to issue a heat allowance, the laborer may complain to the appropriate department in human resources and social security at or above the county level where the employment is located. <span class="highlighted">Also, because heat allowances are part of wages and not benefits, they must be included in total wages and deducted from taxes.</span> Therefore, the heat allowance is not part of the minimum wage and must be paid in cash.

The social circle of cyberspace has become more and more common. It has not only gradually replaced the traditional means of communication by phone, but is also affecting our social circles. It is quietly changing the social lives of people. The benefits of social networking online are obvious, such as the convenience, and especially cater to the young generation. A survey on college students’ social habits shows that 57% of college students spend more than five hours a day using mobile phones, and it has become inseparable with their daily lives. "The social network has the characteristics of inexpensive, fast, and being able to network with a large crowd, which is in line with the needs of college students today." Expanding the circle of interpersonal relationships, a more equal dialogue, and avoiding social concerns are the main reasons why we love chatting online more. New company staffs likes to communicate with their coworkers online. "As many are not familiar with it, they communicated without borders which built a good relationship among them." People who like to make friends also like to use this. "There was an instance where I had lost contact with someone due to a misunderstanding. However I was able to connect with that person again by conversing in groups." Wu Yan, an IT engineer, is an in-depth social networking enthusiast. Most of his social life happens online, where the number of people online is several times more than those offline. Wu Yan admits that being online is "like being a fish in the water". "You can reply your friends at your own pace. You will be able to express yourself better as you have time to think about what to write." "You can stay behind your online ID and avoid face-to-face conflict; will have the peace of mind to think things out before taking action."

A survey investigating college student socializing habits found that 57% of college students spend more than 5 hours a day on cellphones, literally making cellphones "inseparable" during everyday lives. "The characteristics of social networks include being low-cost, having fast transmission rates, and allowing many people to interact simultaneously. This suits the needs of contemporary university students. Expanded relationship circles, being able to chat on equal footing, and avoidance of social stigma are the main reasons why we become increasingly fond of online chat. The newcomers enjoy online communication with other employees, " because we are not familiar with each other at the beginning. But the 'like' and comment in the social media will close the distance." People who enjoy making friends also used online networking. "I haven't been contacting a friend for a while due to some misunderstanding. We then shared a few words in a larger group and things got better from there." IT engineer Wu Yan is strong fan for social networking, and spends most of his socializing time and life online, with many more online contacts than friends he meet offline. Wu Yan himself honestly said that he feels like "fish returned to the water" when he goes online. "You may reply to a friend when you are willing at a time that is convenient for you to do so because there is plenty of time for you to deliberate the wordings, and you can also express yourself more clearly." "The ID provides one with a cover to avoid all face-to-face interpersonal conflicts, providing one with more room to maneuver and also provided both sides with more time and space to think about what they say."

Zhang Donghong, a resident at Dongyuan Village at Xiang'an District in Xiamen, just swapped his old 29-inch television for a large 65-inch set several days ago. This daughter of a common farmer is Zhang Binbin, who just won a silver medal for China in the 50 meter rifle three positions in the Rio Olympics. During the evening of the 11th, Zhang Donghong, his wife, and dozens of other family members and friends stood before this new television and witnessed how his daughter started a miraculous spree that brought her from the brink of being dropped out of the competition to a medal winning score. On the day of the competition, Zhang Binbin had a mid to low ranking at one point, and a spot in the final appeared extremely remote. Parents, family, and friends did not give up, and continued to watch to live stream. When the other athletes completed their firing, Zhang Binbin's rank kept rising until she secured the right to compete in the finals. Everyone at her home exploded in a great cheer. In the finals, Zhang Binbin, who again fell behind in the rankings at one point, became increasingly steady as she fired the last few shots. She finished just 0.2 points behind the champion, clinching the silver medal. Across her 16-year shooting career, Zhang Binbin, who is 27-year old this year, brushed past this hard-won silver medal on several occasions. The mother, Zhang Xiaolong, told the reporter that when everyone was still hesitant, Zhang Binbin found several "young persuaders" from the same village. The "little lobbyists" are the kids from the same family participated the training by recommendation at hat time, including the cousin of Zhang Binbin.

Just like the competition yesterday, this daughter of Xiamen persisted and once again turned the tables in her shooting career. "Every coach has different way of picking team members. At the time, I noticed that Binbin has really nice hands, and fell in love with them immediately." Zhang Donghong also recalled that although his daughter's performance was not the best at the group training test, the number of rounds she shot was very stable. This was also a key factor why Zhang Binbin attracted the attention of her coach. During training, the farm girl Zhang Binbin was so committed that she left a lasting impression with Zhang Yajie. He recollected that more than one year after Zhang Binbin joined the Xiamen shooting team, the team conducted a standing posture rifle firing training. Team members were required to stand still for half an hour. Zhang Xiaolong told the reporter that her daughter is a quiet and obedient child and has loved drawing and making her own toys since a young age. "Originally, I stayed at home to tailor some clothes, sewing and mending them as needed. Binbin would sit by the corner, collecting the scrap fabrics to make her own fabric doll." <span class="highlighted">She said that her daughter would often sew and make her own toys. Coupled with the fact that she was good at drawing, she was able to create a lifelike face and clothing for the dolls she made.</span> As an athlete, Zhang Binbin spends little time with family, and could only return home during weekends and public holidays. Usually, they communicate using the telephone. Her parents said that whether when meeting in person or talking on the phone, Zhang Binbin seldom said she found things difficult. More often than not, she would chat about happy things with parents. Since they hardly see their daughter, the parents carefully preserved the artwork that their girl has made as a child and the glories that she had later won. Zhang Xiaolong showed the reporter the cartoon artwork his daughter created. "If she didn't become a archer, she would probably continue to draw." There is a cabinet located at the second floor living room in Zhang Binbin's home that is filled with the plaques, medals, and certificates that she had won. Zhang Donghong displayed the medals and awards neatly, and kept all the certificates in a folder. "These are the honors Binbin has received over the years on the basis of her hard work and dedication. All of us cherish them."</div>

	<div class="translation" id="171">The Young Zhang Binbin from Xiamen: She started her shooting career as she had "Beautiful Hands" and went through various "struggles". Zhang Donghong from Dongyuan Village in Xiang'an District of Xiamen just replaced an old 29-inch TV with a 65-inch TV at his home. This average farmer's daughter is Zhang Binbin who won the silver medal in the 50 meter rifle three positions event at the Rio Olympic Games for China on the evening of the 11th. Zhang Donghong and his wife along with a number of friends and family were in front of the new TV on the night of the 11th to witness their daughter make a miraculous comeback from almost being eliminated In the day of the event, Zhang Binbin was at one point in the lower part of the ranking and did not seem she would reach the finals. However her parents and close friends did not give up on her as they kept their eyes on the text of the broadcast. Upon seeing other players finishing and where they were ranked, they saw Binbin's name go up the rank and secured a seat in the finals, when the families and friends burst in cheers at home. In the finals, she was on the bottom end of the ranking but her last few shots got more stable and won the silver medal with only 0.2 points behind the champion. For Zhang Binbin who is already 27, it was a hard-fought silver medal in her 16 years of her shooting career. Zhang's mother, Xiaolong told the reporters that when they felt hesitant about her doing this, Zhang Binbin brought a group of "young kids" from the same village to persuade her parents. The "young kids" were from the same village who were also recommended to participate in the training at the same time. Among them was Zhang Binbin's cousin. However, shortly after joining the Xiamen team, Zhang Binbin decided to go back to school in Xiang'an to study due to family hardships. But after the coach Zhang Yajie, kept convincing her, she returned to the Xiamen team again. After being in the provincial team, Zhang Binbin once again failed to get in the national team. As she could not see hope in getting in, she returned home once again. This time, not only coach Zhang, but also the managers and coaches of the Xiamen Shooting and Archery Sports Center and the Fujian provincial team came to her home to persuade Zhang Binbin to return to the provincial team. Like yesterday's game, she persisted and overcame the hurdles in her shooting career. "The way a coach decides who makes the team is different. However for me, I knew she was it when I saw Zhang Binbin's hands." Zhang Donhong also remembered that during the test in the training, despite her scores not being the best, her points were very consistent which was the reason the coaches were fond of Zhang Binbin. In the process of training Zhang Binbin, Zhang Yajie remembered clearly the input provided by this farm girl. He recalls that around 1 year after Zhang Binbin joined the Xiamen Shooting team, the team had a endurance training exercise where they were not allowed to move for half an hour. Zhang Xiaolong told the reporters that her daughter was always a quiet and obedient girl who liked to draw and play with homemade toys when she was small. "When I would sew and repair clothes at home, Binbin would use the scrap pieces and make a doll herself. <span class="highlighted">She said that her daughter would often sew her own toys. As she also liked to draw, the facial expression and the clothes of the dolls she made looked really good.</span> As an athlete, Zhang Binbin saw her family less and less, and would only go back home during the holidays, and usually contacted each other by phone. Her parents said that regardless of being together or on the phone, she would seldom talk about her hardship and would mostly talk about something happy with her parents. As they aren't able to see their daughter often, they make sure to carefully keep the drawings she made when she was little at home. Zhang Xiaolong showed a comic drawn by her daughter to the reporter and said "if she didn't become a shooter, she would have probably continued drawing." In the living room on the second floor of Zhang Binbin's house, there is a cupboard full of medals, and certificates she has won. Zhang Donghong arranged the medals neatly, and the certificates in a folder. “These are the result of Binbin's hard work in these 10 years and so, and are very precious to us."</div>

	<div class="source" id="173">据媒体披露，由于此前资本大规模涌入互联网医药，造成目前产品同质化的问题严重，投资热潮渐退，资本进入观望期。 另据香港艾力彼医院管理研究中心数据显示，创业一年内的互联网医疗公司大量死亡，约20%的初创互联网医疗企业已不复存在。 然而，就在大部分互联网医疗企业挣扎在A轮或B轮的融资路上的时候，有几家细分领域领先企业仍能获得资本热捧。 看来，互联网医疗创业断不可“一窝蜂”，而是要看准市场需求，沉得下心做专，做深。 鱼跃出资1200.00万元，占注册资本的40%，九州通器械公司出资1800.00万元，占注册资本的60%。 近年来，随着国家在医疗信息化方面的政策支持，电子化、集成化的供应链管理系统逐步进入各级医院。 此次鱼跃与九州通的合作正是瞄准了市场的需求，帮助医院搭建先进供应链管理系统，并以此为契机谋求更多合作。 与很多互联网医疗公司贪大求全不同，iBaby从最初就专注于互联网产科垂直领域，深耕孕妈和医生两端。 孕妈不仅可以免费24小时和一对一的主管医生问诊，还可以付费定向寻医问诊。 而在医生端，iBaby通过采取组织专家给基层医生开展在线讲座、同行交流、病例讨论等微讲座的形式，打破地域限制。 目前医生端开设三个板块，分别为医生继续教育、医生社交和医生求助。 提供包括在线学习、病例讨论、学术交流；同医院、同科室医生之间社交平台；医患关系或个人生活所需要的法律援助、创业支持等服务内容。 据媒体报道，CEO王磊近日表示阿里健康“愿意沉下心来”拿下健康大数据。 互联网公司、数据公司缺少专业性，在同一词条上的书写方法上都达不到统一。 阿里目前在医疗健康领域的布局分为三块，分别是阿里健康、天猫医药馆和支付宝未来医院。 <span class="highlighted">王磊坦言，医疗健康创业会比其他行业要难，“这不仅仅是有多少钱的事情，还要沉得下心，耐得住寂寞慢慢去做。”</span></div>
	<div class="translation" id="173">According to media reports, due to the previous large-scale influx of capital into Internet medicine, resulting in the current serious problem of product homogenization, the investment boom gradually receded, capital into a wait and see period. According to data from the Centre for Management Research at Ellison Hospital in Hong Kong, a large number of Internet medical companies have died within one year of their establishment, and about 20 per cent of the start-up Internet medical companies have ceased to exist. However, just as most internet healthcare companies struggle to finance rounds A and B, several segment leaders are still gaining traction. It seems that the Internet can not be a medical entrepreneurship "swarm", but to look at the market demand, sink down to do special, do deep. Yuyue made a capital contribution of 12 million yuan, accounting for 40 percent of the registered capital, and Kyushu Tong Instrument Company made a capital contribution of 18 million yuan, accounting for 60 percent of the registered capital. In recent years, with the state's policy support in medical information, electronic, integrated supply chain management system gradually into all levels of hospitals. The cooperation between Yuyue and Kyushu Tong is precisely aimed at the needs of the market, helping hospitals to build advanced supply chain management system, and using this as an opportunity to seek more cooperation. Unlike many internet healthcare companies, iBaby has been focused on the internet obstetrics vertical since its inception, working both as a mother and a doctor. Pregnant mothers are not only entitled to free 24-hour and one-on-one consultation with a doctor in charge, but are also entitled to paid, directed medical consultation. At the doctor's end, iBaby breaks geographical boundaries by organizing experts to give microlectures, such as online lectures, peer-to-peer exchanges, and case discussions, to doctors at the grass-roots level. At present, the doctor side opened three sections, respectively, for doctors to continue education, doctors social and doctors for help. Services include online learning, case discussions, academic exchanges, social networking platforms with hospitals and doctors in departments, legal assistance for doctor-patient relationships or personal life, and support for entrepreneurship. CEO Wang Lei recently said Ali Health was "willing to sink in" to take down health big data, according to media reports. Internet companies, data companies lack professionalism in the same entry on the writing methods are not uniform. Ali's current layout in the field of health care is divided into three sections, namely Ali Health, Tmall Medicine Hall and Alipay Future Hospital. <span class="highlighted">"It's not just a matter of how much money you have," Wang admits. "It's a matter of getting down and being able to live with the loneliness and do it slowly."</span></div>
	<div class="translation" id="173">According to media reports, due to the large surge of capital into IOMT (internet of medical things), which resulted in a serious issue of product consistency. With the investment boom slowing down, investments have entered a wait-and-see period. According to data from the Hong Kong Alec Hospital Management Research Center, a large number of venture IOMT companies have gone out of business within a year of starting, and about 20% of them have disappeared. However, just as most of the IOMT companies struggled in the A or B round of financing, there were several leading companies in the niche areas who were still able to obtain sufficient capital. From this observation, one can say that these IOMT cannot "simply all come about doing the same thing", but to watch the market demand and do their due diligence. Jiangsu Yuyue Mdcl Eqpmnt & Spply Co Ltd. invested 120 million yuan, accounting for 40% of the registered capital, and Jiuzhou Tongji Machinery Co., Ltd. invested 180 million yuan, accounting for 60% of the registered capital. In recent years, the digitalized and integrated supply chain management system is slowly being utilized in various levels of hospitals thanks to country's support in the form of policies on the information of IOMT. The cooperation between Jiangsu Yuyue Mdcl Eqpmnt & Spply Co Ltd. and Jiuzhou Tongji Machinery Co., Ltd. targets the market demands, supports hospitals implement advanced supply chain management systems and use this as an opportunity to seek further collaboration. Unlike many IOMT companies, iBaby has been focusing on the vertical field of obstetrics for the Internet from the very beginning and has been working with both mothers and doctors. "On a 24-hour basis, pregnant mothers can not only receive free one-on-one consultations with qualified doctors, and also receive paid medical diagnosis." From the doctor's side, iBaby allows them to provide lectures, communicate better with peers, discuss cases beyond the geographic barriers. Currently, the doctors can set up three sections for doctors to continue their education, communicate with other doctors, and request help from doctors. This provides business support for online learning, case discussions, academic exchanges; social networking with hospitals and doctors in the same department, and necessary legal support relating to doctor-patient relationship. According to media reports, CEO Wang Lei recently stated that AliHealth "has decided" to compile the healthcare data. Tech companies and data companies lack professionalism and cannot cooperate. Alibaba's current presence in the healthcare industry is divided into three sections: AliHealth, Tmall Online Pharmacy, and Alipay's "Future Hospital" program. <span class="highlighted">Wang Lei admitted that business in the healthcare is more difficult than other industries. “It is not simply having enough money, but to be able to persevere and work step by step."</span></div>
	<div class="translation" id="173">Media revealed that the deluge of capital that swamped online health care resulted in the severe product homogeneity problem we see today. The investment boom is waning gradually. Capital has entered a wait-and-see period. Figures from Hong Kong Ailibi Hospital Management Research Center revealed that many online health care companies close down within the first year of incorporation; approximately 20% of newly founded online health care enterprises no longer exist. However, while most Internet health care companies were struggling to choose between Series A or Series B financing, a number of leading companies in specialized sectors were still able to attract capital. It seems that "rushing headlong" into the Industry healthcare sector is not the wisest option. One must accurately assess market requirements, be patient, and improve the professionalism and depth of services provided. Yuyue contributed 12.0000 million dollars, comprising 40% of the registered capital, while Jointown Pharmaceutical provided 18.0000 million dollars for 60% of the registered capital. In recent years, thanks to national policy support in terms of medical informatization, electronic and integrated supply chain management systems have been gradually introduced into different classes of hospitals. The partnership between Yuyue and Jointown Pharmaceutical aims at meeting market demands and helping hospital establish an advanced supply chain management system. The partnership is also an opportunity to seek additional partnerships. Unlike many Internet health care companies obsessed with scale and extensive coverage, iBaby focused on the vertical industry of obstetrics from the very beginning, channeling their efforts toward supporting both pregnant mothers and their physicians. Pregnant mothers can receive 24-hours one-on-one consultation with a specialist physician for free. They can also pay for personal consultation with a specified physician. At the doctors' end, iBaby has broken down regional restrictions by way of organizing experts to carry out webinars, peer exchanges, case discussions and other mini-seminars. Currently, three segments have been set up at the doctor's end, namely, continuing education for doctors, social networking for doctors, and help for doctors. The contents provided include online learning, medical case studies, and academic exchange; social networking platform between physicians of the same hospital or same departments; and doctor-patient relationships or legal assistance necessary for personal lifestyles, entrepreneurship support, and other services. Media report that CEO Wang Lei expressed that Alibaba Health is "willing to settle down" and takeover the Big Data analytics for health. Online businesses and data companies lack professionalism, and were unable to achieve uniformity in the terminologies of identical keywords. Alibaba has structured its presence in the health care industry into three segments, namely Alibaba Health, Tmall Pharmacy, and Alipay's Future Hospital. <span class="highlighted">Wang Lei disclosed that starting a medical healthcare company is more challenging when compared to other sectors. "This is not just about making money. You must be patient and get used to loneliness to do this properly."</span></div>

	<div class="translation" id="174">Although it hasn't been confirmed, numerous sources have said Apple's fall 2016 launch will take place in September, and the iPhone 7 is really coming. Apple didn't respond, but word has spread about the new iPhone's features and configuration, and even pictures of the iPhone 7's "real model" are available online. The next generation of iPhones is "eye-catching", hot, hot, rich and out of stock... If you want to buy the real thing for the first time, make sure you choose a good channel, say, Suning. This added to the frustration over the new phone, "It lengthens, but it doesn't project a hologram at all! This generation of iPhones sucks." The iPhone 7, like other iPhones, has been accompanied by countless secrets before it was born. Also, multiple sources have claimed that the new iPhone will eliminate the 3.5mm headphone jack and instead use a Bluetooth connection and charging jack, which would give Apple room to add a second speaker. Another piece of evidence to back up the news is that back in 2014 Apple allowed headphone makers to make headphone products that were connected through a charging interface. The news is either true or false, and the answer won't be revealed until Apple's autumn 2016 launch. But that doesn't detract from the industry's bullish outlook for the iPhone 7 - which many believe will most likely be Apple's last major upgrade to the iPhone family. <span class="highlighted">Though the iPhone's market share has fallen, according to data released recently by market research firm IDC.</span> Among them, Goldman Sachs maintained a "buy" rating on Apple's stock, while BMO analysts said the iPhone 7 would reap a historic sales performance. At the same time, Hock Tan, CEO of Broadcom, said it was likely that Apple would increase revenue by more than 20 percent in the future, thanks entirely to the launch of the iPhone 7. Seven percent of respondents said they planned to buy the iPhone 7, compared with just four percent two years ago. It is understood that 20 per cent of the current group of users who hold the iPhone 6 or 6Plus plan to buy the iPhone 7, which is a fairly high percentage. Second, there is expert analysis, most of the fruit powder like to replace their iPhone handsets from generation to generation. About 26 percent of all iPhone users have not changed their phone in two years, or nearly 120 million users have had their iPhone for two years, according to the report. Media captionTaiwan has been hit by several earthquakes during the production of the iPhone 7. "TSMC's production facilities have been damaged beyond imagination and could have an impact on the initial supply of the iPhone 7." Contradictions between supply and demand will affect ordinary users, it is time to choose a good channel, the first time low prices to start the genuine iPhone 7. According to people familiar with the matter, recently, Suning executives have been meeting with Apple frequently in order to prepare an adequate supply. The operator has already negotiated with Suning, and predictably, with the deep cooperation between the two sides, it is bound to bring lower prices and more intimate services to users. "At the lowest price, consumers might be able to buy an iPhone 7 for as little as $7 a day," he said. Sufficient supply and a variety of concessions, so that the purchase of the iPhone 7 is no longer "pressure mountain," and Suning's logistics, is to turn this beautiful into a more intuitive experience. Maybe you'll get a call in the middle of the night saying, "Hello, Suning EasyJet, your iPhone 7 is here."</div>
	<div class="translation" id="174">Although it has yet to be proven, many information sources indicate that Apple will hold its 2016 Fall event in September. iPhone 7 is really on its way. Although Apple did not respond, news concerning the functions and configuration of the iPhone are being released gradually. Pictures of the "actual phone model" have even appeared on the Internet. The new iPhone could be considered a "public phenomenon". It's popular, sleek, and could not be acquired even if you have the money to pay for it. If you want to buy an original product, you must opt for a proper sales channel such as Suning. This heightened the people's sense of disappointment for the new cellphone. "It became longer, but couldn't project holographs! This iPhone release sucks." Like other iPhones, numerous anecdotes and secret information accompanied the iPhone 7 before its debut. Elsewhere, many sources of information also claimed that the 3.5mm headphone jack will be removed from the new iPhone to be replaced by bluetooth connection and the charging interface. This will give Apple room for adding a second speaker. Another piece of corroborative evidence is that as far back as 2014, Apple had already allowed headphone manufacturers to connect headphone products through the charging interface. The answer to such news, whether true or false, will only be revealed by Apple at the 2016 Fall launch event. This did not stop industry insiders from taking a positive view of the prospects of iPhone 7 however. Many believed that iPhone 7 could very well be the last time Apple would significantly upgrade the iPhone series. <span class="highlighted">However, data recently published by IDC, a market intelligence firm, showed the market share of iPhone has decreased slightly.</span> Goldman Sachs has rated Apple shares as something that can be "bought". BMO analysts believe that iPhone7 will establish a historical record in sales performance. Broadcom CEO Hock Tan also expressed that Apple is expected to achieve more than 20% growth in revenue. This figure can be completely attributed to the release of iPhone7. 7% of those interviewed said they intend to buy iPhone 7 compared to a mere 4% who planned to buy iPhone 6 two years ago. From information available, 20% of users currently holding an iPhone6 or 6Plus have plans for purchasing iPhone7. This proportion is quite substantial. Next, experts analyzed that most Apple fans like to replace their iPhone every other generation. Statistics revealed that among iPhone users, approximately 26% of users have not changed their mobile phones in two years, i.e., the iPhones of about 120 million users have been used for two years. Some media reported that Taiwan has been hit by several earthquakes during the iPhone7 production period. "Damages sustained by TSMC production facilities may have went beyond expectations, and that could have influenced initial supply for iPhone7." Supply and demand conflicts will influence normal users. It is time to select a proper channel and acquire an authentic iPhone7 early at a low price. Insider disclosure revealed that the upper management of Suning and Apple has met frequently in recent times for the purpose of preparing enough resources. Service operators have reached an agreement with Suning. It can be expected that with growing partnership between the two, users will be provided with lower prices and more dedicated services. " The lowest price. The customers might' only RMB 7 a day to get a iPhone7". Sufficient supply of goods and a variety of discounts, buyers of iPhone 7 will not be so stressed out, and Suning's logistics department will all the more turn this happiness into a more intuitive experience. Perhaps you will receive a phone call at midnight. "Hello, this is Suning.com. Your iPhone 7 has arrived."</div>
	<div class="translation" id="174">It has not yet been confirmed yet, but many sources have indicated that Apple's 2016 fall conference will be held in September. The iPhone 7 is really going to come out. Although Apple did not comment, information and specification of the new iPhone has been released and there are "actual" photos of the iPhone 7 on the web. The new generation of the iPhone is going to be slick, popular, and limited, thus if you want to be one of the first one to get a hold of it, be sure to know where to buy it from...like Suning. "This has led to further disappointment in the new phone. It is longer but can't even take videos. This generation of iPhone is terrible." Like the other iPhones, iPhone 7 had its share of secrets before being released. In addition, there are multiple sources claiming that the new generation of iPhone will not feature a 3.5mm headphone jack and use Bluetooth connectivity instead and will just have the charging port. This will provide space for Apple to add a second speaker. As evidence to backup this claim, Apple had developed earphones that would connect to the charging port back in 2014. Regardless of whether the rumors are true or not, we will only know for sure when it is announced in Apple's fall 2016 conference. However, this does not prevent the industry from looking at the potential specification of the iPhone 7 - many believe that the iPhone 7 will most likely be Apple's last major upgrade to the iPhone series. <span class="highlighted">IDC, which is a market research institute recently released data that the market share of iPhone has declined.</span> However, Goldman Sachs will maintain the "buy" rating for Apple's stock, and BMO analysts believe that iPhone7 will come together with a historic sales performance.

Seven percent of respondents said they had plans to purchase the iPhone 7, compared to only four percent who planned to purchase the iPhone 6 two years ago. It is understood that 20% of those currently using the iPhone 6 or 6 Plus plan to purchase the iPhone 7, which is a very high percentage. Also, experts analyzed that most of Apple consumers like to replace their iPhones every generation. According to the data, about 26% of all iPhone users have not changed their phones for 2 years. Which means almost 120 million people have used the iPhone for 2 years. Some media claimed that Taiwan faced several earthquakes during the production of iPhone 7 and, “The damage of TSMC's production facilities was bigger than expected and may affect the initial iPhone 7 supply.” The disparity between supply and demand will affect the average customers. It is time to choose a good place to buy an authentic iPhone 7 early at a lower price. According to informed sources, Suning executives met frequently with Apple in order to prepare enough stock. The company is already in discussion with Suning, and will inevitable provide a lower price and better service for consumers through a high-level of cooperation between the two parties. “At the lowest price, consumers may only need to pay 7 yuan a day to purchase the iPhone 7.” Plentiful stock and various services will make purchasing the iPhone less stressful. Through Suning's logistics, will further lead to a heightened buying experience. You may perhaps get a call in the middle of a night which will say "Hi this is Suning.com.

	<div class="source" id="175">根据重庆市气象局门户网对各区县高温天气的统计，除酉阳外，我市其余各地都能领取到不同程度的高温津贴。 目前全国至少已有28个省份明确了津贴发放标准，不过各省市发放的标准并不一样，而重庆则是按高温工作日津贴的方式领取高温津贴。 35℃以上37℃以下的，按每人每天不低于10元标准发放；37℃以上的，按每人每天不低于15元标准发放。 40℃以上高温工作人员每月最多可领20元/天的津贴（劳动者已经依法享受高温作业岗位津贴的除外）。 按照这一标准，上个月高温天气天数最多的开州能领到330元，天数最少的城口则是80元，而酉阳最高温由于没达到高温标准外，所以没有高温津贴。 以往不少单位会以清凉饮品冲抵高温津贴，市安监局表示这种行径不合乎现行办法。 因高温天气停止工作、缩短工作时间的，用人单位不得扣除或降低劳动者工资。 <span class="highlighted">市人社局表示，员工遇到高温下作业却没收到高温津贴的，可通过企业所在的劳动争议调解机构争取合法权益，或拨打12333投诉。</span> 有用人单位拒不发放高温津贴的，劳动者可向用工所在地县级以上人力资源社会保障主管部门投诉。 同时由于高温津贴是工资的一部分，不是福利，要纳入工资总额、扣减个税。 因此高温津贴不在最低工资范围内，必须以现金形式发放，不能用饮料等实物代替。</div>
	<div class="translation" id="175">According to the Chongqing Meteorological Bureau portal to the high temperature of the counties statistics, in addition to Youyang, the rest of the city can receive different degrees of high temperature allowance. At least 28 provinces across the country have now clarified the criteria for the payment of allowances, although the criteria are not the same in the provinces and municipalities, while Chongqing receives a high-temperature allowance in the form of a high-temperature working day allowance. If the temperature is above 35 ° C and below 37 ° C, the standard is not less than 10 yuan per person per day, and if the temperature is above 37 ° C, the standard is not less than 15 yuan per person per day. High temperature workers above 40 ℃ are entitled to a monthly allowance of up to 20 yuan / day (except for those workers who have already enjoyed the post allowance for high temperature operation in accordance with the law). According to this standard, last month, the highest number of days of hot weather in Kaizhou can receive 330 yuan, the number of days the least Chengkou is 80 yuan, and Youyang the highest temperature due to not meet the high temperature standards, so there is no high temperature allowance. In the past, many units would offset the high temperature allowance with refreshing drinks. The City Safety Supervision Bureau said that this practice was not in line with the current practice. The employing units shall not deduct or reduce the wages of the workers if they stop working or shorten their working hours due to the hot weather. <span class="highlighted">The city's social service bureau said employees who have not received a high temperature allowance for working in high temperatures can fight for their legitimate rights and interests through the labor dispute mediation agency where the business is located, or call 12333 to lodge a complaint.</span> If an employing unit refuses to pay a high-temperature allowance, the worker may file a complaint with the department in charge of human resources and social security at or above the county level in the place where the employee is employed. At the same time, since the high temperature allowance is part of the salary and not a benefit, it is included in the total salary and deducted from the tax. The high temperature allowance is therefore not covered by the minimum wage and must be paid in cash and cannot be substituted in kind, such as beverages.</div>
	<div class="translation" id="175">Statistics on high temperature days of various districts provided on portal website of the Chongqing City Meteorological Administration said that with the exception of Youyang County, every area in the city could receive varying amounts of high temperature subsidies. Currently, at least 28 provinces in the country have clarified their subsidy disbursement criteria, but the disbursement criteria differs among provinces. In Chongqing, high-temperature subsidy is received based on subsidy for high-temperature working days. At temperatures equal or more than 35℃ and less than 37℃, each person shall be given a fee of not less than RMB10 per day. At temperatures higher than 37℃, each person shall be given a fee of not less than RMB15 per day. Workers working at above a temperature of 40℃ can receive a monthly subsidy of up to 20 RMB per day (this does not apply to a worker who is already provided with a high temperature operation subsidy according to law). According to this criteria, Kaizhou, which experienced the most number of high-temperature days last month would receive RMB330, while Chengkou which experienced the least number of days would received RMB80. As the highest temperature in Youyang did not exceed the high temperature benchmark, it did not receive any high-temperature subsidy. In the past, many companies often use cooling and refreshing beverages to offset the high temperature subsidy. The city administration of work safety, however, expressed that this act is not compliant to the current laws. Employers may not deduct or reduce the salary of laborers if work has to be suspended or work time reduced due to high temperatures. <span class="highlighted">The municipal human resources and social security bureau said that workers who worked under high temperatures without receiving high temperature allowance may fight for their legal rights by way of the labor dispute mediation mechanism, or call 12333 to file a complaint.</span> In case employer refuse to pay high-temperature allowance, employee is entitled to complain to the local administrative authority of HR and social security at the county level. Also, since the high temperature subsidy is considered part of the salary and not a benefit, it is included in total salary and subject to the personal income tax. High temperature subsidies are not included considered part of the minimum wage and must be issued in the form of cash. They cannot be replaced in the form of beverages or other tangible items.</div>
	<div class="translation" id="175">According to statistics of the Chongqing Municipal Meteorological Bureau portal on the high-temperature weather in various districts and counties except Fuyang, the rest of the city may have a deviance on the high temperature. Currently, there are at least 28 provinces in China that have clearly defined the standards for the subsidy. However, the standards issued by provinces and cities are not the same. Chongqing, on one other hand, receives heat allowances in the form of heat allowances on weekdays. If the temperature is 35°C to 37°C , a rate of not less than 10 yuan per person per day; if it exceeds 37°C, the rate shall not be less than 15 yuan per person per day. Workers working in high temperature environment above 40°C can receive up to 20 yuan per day per month (except for laborers who already receive the heat allowance according to law). According to this standard, Kaizhou, had the most days of high-temperature weather last month, and was able to receive 330 yuan, and Chengkou had the least number of days which equated to 80 yuan. The highest temperature recorded in Puyang did not reach the high temperature standard, so there was no heat allowance. In the past, many would give cold drinks instead of heat allowances. The City Work Safety Administration stated that such practices are not in line with current regulations. The employer may not deduct or reduce the wages of workers due to the stoppage of work due to high temperature and reduce working hours. <span class="highlighted">The Municipal Bureau of Human Resources and Social Affairs stated that when an employee faces a situation where a the work environment is considered high-temperature but does not receive a heat allowance, he or she can seek legal rights through the labor dispute mediation agency where the company is located, or call 12333 to file a complaint.</span> Where a company refuses to issue a heat allowance, the laborer may complain to the appropriate department in human resources and social security at or above the county level where the employment is located. Also, because heat allowances are part of wages and not benefits, they must be included in total wages and deducted from taxes. Therefore, the heat allowance is not part of the minimum wage and must be paid in cash. It cannot be replaced with physical items such as drinks.</div>

	<div class="source" id="176">很多NBA球员都证明了自己的实力。但是有人进步就有人衰落。 无论是因为年龄的增大还是出场时间被限制，每个赛季都有一些球员的表现会出现退步。 当然了，有些“退步”可能仅仅是数据的缩水，这些球员的实力可能并未下降。 即便韦德仍是联盟里最好的得分后卫之一，但是他在公牛的表现应该不会有热火那么好了。 他和隆多组成的后场射程有限，当家球星巴特勒的三分命中率也只有32.8%，这让他们下赛季的进攻会打得很拥挤。 来到了风城，闪电侠势必把球权更多地让给巴特勒和隆多，自己很可能在常规赛选择养生打法。 奥卡福的情况比较尴尬，作为上赛季76人的第一选择，他在新赛季不得不和西蒙斯以及恩比德竞争上场时间和球权。 这一竞争可能不会来的很快，西蒙斯还需要适应NBA赛场，恩比德也要尽快从伤病中完全恢复，但是奥卡福能否在76人的长人阵中有位置还是个问题。 上个赛季，奥卡福32%的得分来自低位进攻，这一比例高于考辛斯、武切维奇和布鲁克·洛佩斯，同时他的使用率也高居联盟前40。 随着西蒙斯已经展现了出色的控球前锋潜质，恩比德也拥有着更适合NBA比赛的身材，奥卡福的地位恐怕很难再那么稳固了。 过去两个赛季，汤普森的使用率已经稳定在了联盟前20，而这也是他生涯最出色的两个赛季。 不过问题是，随着杜兰特的到来，汤普森的使用率一定会下降，这势必将影响他的发挥。 这一影响将不仅是出手次数的影响，汤神的持球进攻在下赛季肯定也会大大减少，这在某些方面也会降低对手对他的防守难度。 <span class="highlighted">杜兰特的到来一定会让勇士队的球员们数据缩水，但这其中缩水最严重的恐怕就是汤普森了。</span> 但这并不意味着汤神的水平退步，这更像是他为球队整体做出了牺牲。 帕克在上个赛季表现得比数据反映的要好些，不仅是因为他的篮下效率来到了生涯最高，他和阿尔德里奇的化学反应也让马刺队受益。 邓肯退役，吉诺比利宣布再战一年，GDP的组合最终也走到了尽头，作为三个人里最年轻的一个，法国跑车的油箱里也没有多少油了。 在得到了第三枚总冠军戒指之后，只有贾巴尔、乔丹和拉塞尔比詹姆斯赢得了更多的常规赛MVP，而乔丹是唯一一个FMVP比詹姆斯多的人。 哦，对了，詹姆斯刚刚为克利夫兰带来了过去52年里第一座职业体育冠军奖杯。 来到了职业生涯第14个赛季的詹姆斯需要更好的保证体力，为季后赛做好准备。 因此，在常规赛里，詹姆斯的数据很可能进一步下滑，他会把更多的重担分给欧文来承担，不过他仍然会轻松地成为联盟前三的球员。</div>
	<div class="translation" id="176">A lot of NBA players have proven themselves, but some have improved and others have declined. Whether it's because of increased age or limited playing time, there are a number of players who have regressed every season. Of course, some of the "regressions" may simply be data shrinkage, and the strength of these players may not have diminished. Even though Wade is still one of the best shooting guards in the league, he probably won't do as well with the Bulls as the Heat. He and Rondo have limited backcourt range and the establishment star Butler is shooting just 32.8 percent from three-point range, making their offense crowded for next season. Coming to Windy City, the Blitzkrieg is bound to cede more of the ball to Butler and Rondo, and he is likely to choose a regimen to play during the regular season. Okafor is in an awkward position, having to compete with Simmons and Embiid for playing time and ball rights in the new season as the first choice for the 76ers last season. The rivalry may not come soon, Simmons will have to adapt to the NBA and Embiid will have to fully recover from the injury as soon as possible, but Okafor's place in the 76ers' lineup remains a question. Okafor scored 32 percent from the low post offense last season, a higher percentage than Cousins, Vucevic and Brooke Lopez, while his usage rates were also high in the league's top 40. With Simmons already showing excellent possession forward potential and Embiid in better shape for NBA games, Okafor's position is likely to be hard to get any more secure. Thompson's usage has stabilized in the league's top 20 over the past two seasons, the best of his career. The problem, though, is that Thompson's usage is bound to decline with Durant's arrival, and that's bound to affect his play. The impact will be not only in terms of the number of shots taken, but the Towns' holding offense will certainly be significantly reduced next season, which in some ways will also make it easier for opponents to defend him. <span class="highlighted">Durant's arrival is sure to shrink the Warriors' player numbers, but it's probably Thompson who has lost the most.</span> But that doesn't mean that Tommy's level has regressed, it's more like he's made sacrifices for the team as a whole. Parker did better last season than the numbers suggest, not only because his basketball efficiency was at its highest in his career, but also because his chemistry with Aldridge benefited the Spurs. Duncan retired, Ginobili announced another year of fighting, and the GDP combination finally came to an end, and as the youngest of the three, the French sports car didn't have much fuel in its tank. After getting their third championship ring, only Abdul-Jabbar, Jordan and Russell won more regular-season MVPs than James, and Jordan was the only one with more than James. Oh, and by the way, James has just brought Cleveland its first Pro Sports Championship trophy in the last 52 years. James, who arrived in his 14th season of his career, needs to be better guaranteed physical strength and ready for the playoffs. As a result, James' numbers are likely to slide further during the regular season, and he'll share more of the burden with Irving, though he'll still be an easy top-three player in the league.</div>
	<div class="translation" id="176">Many NBA players are able to prove their ability to play but there are people who fall off. Whether it is due to age or limited playing time, there are always players who gets worse each season. Of course those deemed to have "gotten worse" may just be due to the limited stats and data, and they may actually not have gotten worse. Despite Dwayne Wade being one of the top shooting guards in the league, he will probably not perform as well with the Bulls than he did back with the Heat. The backcourt range of Wade and Rondo is limited and Butler who is the star player only has a 32.8% 3-point percentage. This will make their offence limited in the next season. In the windy city, the Flash (Wade) needs to give control of the ball more to Butler and Rondo, while he takes a more conservative approach and stay healthy. Okafor's situation is more awkward. Despite being the number one draft for the 76ers last season, he has to compete with Simmons and Embiid for playing time and ball in the upcoming season. Playing for the spot won't be right away as Simmons still needs to get used to the NBA games, and Embiid need to quickly recover from injuries. The issue remains if Okafor will be able to stay in the 76'ers roster in the long run. Last season, Okafor' was scoring 32% from the low post, which is higher than Cousins, Vucevic, and Brook Lopez. He also has a usage rate of 40 in the league. With Simmons already showing excellent potential as a forward, and Embiid having good potential for the NBA, it may be difficult for Okafor to find a stable role. In the past two seasons, Thompson's usage rate has stabilized at the top 20 in the league, and his last two seasons has been the best in his career. However, with Durant joining the team, the issues would be that Thompson's use rate will certainly decline, and is bound to affect his performance. This will impact his shots taken and will surely reduce greatly next season and make the opponent defend him easier. <span class="highlighted">The arrival of Durant will limit the stats of the Warrior's players, and the player that would be the most affected would most likely be Thompson.</span> But this does not mean Thompson's playing ability will get worse. It is more a matter of fact that he will need to make some sacrifice for the team. Parker performed better than the data reflected last season, not only because his efficiency was at the highest level of his career, but his chemistry with Aldridge also benefited the Spurs. With Duncan retiring and Ginobili playing one last season, the era of Ginobili, Duncan and Parker will finally come to an end. As the youngest of the three, there is not much gas left in the tank for the French import. After winning the third championship ring, only Jabbar, Jordan and Russell and James won more regular-season MVPs, and Jordan is the only person with more Finals MVP than James. Oh and James has just brought home Cleveland's first professional sports championship cup in 52 years. In LeBron's 14 season of his career, he will need to maintain his physical condition to prepare for the playoffs. His stats will probably decline in the regular season as give the ball more to Osman. However, he will still easily be the top three players in the league.</div>
	<div class="translation" id="176">Many NBA players have proven themselves, but progress for some meant regress for others. Due to aging or restrictions on playing time, performance of several players may become worse for each season. Of course, some of this "degeneration" could be attributed to lowered statistics, but the true ability of these players probably stayed the same. Although Wade is still regarded as one of the best shooting guards in the NBA, his performance with the Bulls will unlikely be as good as when he was at Miami Heat. He and Rondo has limited perimeter shot range, and their superstar Butler only has a 32.8% chance of scoring with a three-point shot. Offenses they head for the next season will be extremely crowded. After arriving at the Windy City, Wade "the Lightning" will, where possible, pass the ball to Butler and Rondo while he himself adopts a more wholesome gameplay strategy in conventional games. Okafor's position is quite precarious. As the only option for the 76ers in the last season, he was forced to jostle with Simons and Embiid for play time and ownership of the ball during the new season. This competition may not be imminent. Simmons still has to adapt to the NBA game. Embiid also has to fully recover from his injuries as soon as possible. Whether Okafor will hold a permanent position in the 76ers however, remains questionable. In the previous season, Okafor's 32% scoring rate was attributed to low post offense. This ratio was higher than that of Cousins, Vučević, and Brook Lopez. His usage rate is also amongst the top-40 of the entire NBA. As Simmons has demonstrated great potential as a point forward and Embiid is starting to get a physique more suitable for NBA games, Okafor's position will only become less stable. For the last two seasons, Thompson has been one of the top-20 most commonly fielded players in the NBA. Those were his most impressive two seasons in his entire career. The problem is that with the arrival of Durant, the chance for having Thompson play in the games will definitely drop, further lowering his chances of performing. This not only affected the chances for Thompson to play the game, his field goal attempts will be vastly reduced in the next season, and reduce the challenges faced by his opponents when defending against him. <span class="highlighted">The arrival of Durant will definitely result in a drop in numbers among Warriors' players, but Thompson will probably have the most to lose.</span> This does not mean that Thompson's standards have dropped. In fact, it appears that he's making sacrifices for the sake of the entire team. Parker's performance last season was better than his stats suggested. Not only did Parker achieve his career best in rebound efficiency, his chemistry with Aldridge also benefited the Spurs. Duncan has retired, while Ginóbili announced that he will play for another year. The GDP combination has finally come to an end. As the youngest of the three, there is little gas in the tank of the French sports car. Only Jabbar, Jordan, and Russell won more standard MVP games than James after obtaining their third championship rings. Jordan is the only person with more FMVP than James. O yes, James has just helped deliver the first professional sports championship trophy to Cleveland in 52 years. James, who is in the 14th season of his professional career, needs to better retain his physical strength to prepare well for the playoffs. Therefore, during the regular season, James' stats may well decline further. He will share more of his burden with Owen but he will easily remain one of the top 3 NBA players.</div>

The four shipping lanes are tributary channels of the Beijing-Hangzhou Grand Canal, and were upgraded and reconstructed by way of public financing. The project for upgrading and reconstructing the Zhushui River navigation channel is a first time attempt to use a "government + market" model. The project is an infrastructure undertaking for river ports in Shandong Province, with the government being the main investor while social investments make up for the gap in funding required. Baima River, Laowanfu River, Beidaliu River and other tributary navigational channels have adopted a pure market-based operating approach.

Therefore, the problem of high pollution, large energy usage, and land occupation has not yet been fundamentally dealt with from the change in production and lifestyle. On one hand, Jiangsu Province ranks first in the country on the effectiveness of the use of land; however, on the other hand, it places a large burden on the resource and environment. To promote ecological environmental protection and governance thoroughly, we must fundamentally promote changes in production and lifestyle to benefit the people.</div>

Therefore, there has been a lack of radical response to issues pertaining to heavy pollution, big energy and large land coverage in terms of a change in production methods and lifestyle. On the one hand, based on the results of the establishment of various levels and types of ecological environment in Jiangsu Province, it ranks first on an overwhelming basis. On the other hand, however, the resource environment in under significant pressure. Effective promotion of ecological conservation and governance requires a fundamental transformation of production methods and lifestyles. An ecological and civilized approach to development can promote and benefit everyday life.</div>

The investment boom is waning gradually. Capital has entered a wait-and-see period. Figures from Hong Kong Ailibi Hospital Management Research Center revealed that many online health care companies close down within the first year of incorporation; approximately 20% of newly founded online health care enterprises no longer exist. However, while most Internet health care companies were struggling to choose between Series A or Series B financing, a number of leading companies in specialized sectors were still able to attract capital. It seems that "rushing headlong" into the Industry healthcare sector is not the wisest option. One must accurately assess market requirements, be patient, and improve the professionalism and depth of services provided. Yuyue contributed 12.0000 million dollars, comprising 40% of the registered capital, while Jointown Pharmaceutical provided 18.0000 million dollars for 60% of the registered capital. In recent years, thanks to national policy support in terms of medical informatization, electronic and integrated supply chain management systems have been gradually introduced into different classes of hospitals. The partnership between Yuyue and Jointown Pharmaceutical aims at meeting market demands and helping hospital establish an advanced supply chain management system. The partnership is also an opportunity to seek additional partnerships. Unlike many Internet health care companies obsessed with scale and extensive coverage, iBaby focused on the vertical industry of obstetrics from the very beginning, channeling their efforts toward supporting both pregnant mothers and their physicians. Pregnant mothers can receive 24-hours one-on-one consultation with a specialist physician for free. They can also pay for personal consultation with a specified physician. At the doctors' end, iBaby has broken down regional restrictions by way of organizing experts to carry out webinars, peer exchanges, case discussions and other mini-seminars. Currently, three segments have been set up at the doctor's end, namely, continuing education for doctors, social networking for doctors, and help for doctors.

	<div class="translation" id="190">The Young Zhang Binbin from Xiamen: She started her shooting career as she had "Beautiful Hands" and went through various "struggles". Zhang Donghong from Dongyuan Village in Xiang'an District of Xiamen just replaced an old 29-inch TV with a 65-inch TV at his home. <span class="highlighted">This average farmer's daughter is Zhang Binbin who won the silver medal in the 50 meter rifle three positions event at the Rio Olympic Games for China on the evening of the 11th.</span> Zhang Donghong and his wife along with a number of friends and family were in front of the new TV on the night of the 11th to witness their daughter make a miraculous comeback from almost being eliminated In the day of the event, Zhang Binbin was at one point in the lower part of the ranking and did not seem she would reach the finals. However her parents and close friends did not give up on her as they kept their eyes on the text of the broadcast. Upon seeing other players finishing and where they were ranked, they saw Binbin's name go up the rank and secured a seat in the finals, when the families and friends burst in cheers at home. In the finals, she was on the bottom end of the ranking but her last few shots got more stable and won the silver medal with only 0.2 points behind the champion. For Zhang Binbin who is already 27, it was a hard-fought silver medal in her 16 years of her shooting career. Zhang's mother, Xiaolong told the reporters that when they felt hesitant about her doing this, Zhang Binbin brought a group of "young kids" from the same village to persuade her parents. The "young kids" were from the same village who were also recommended to participate in the training at the same time. Among them was Zhang Binbin's cousin. However, shortly after joining the Xiamen team, Zhang Binbin decided to go back to school in Xiang'an to study due to family hardships. But after the coach Zhang Yajie, kept convincing her, she returned to the Xiamen team again. After being in the provincial team, Zhang Binbin once again failed to get in the national team. As she could not see hope in getting in, she returned home once again. This time, not only coach Zhang, but also the managers and coaches of the Xiamen Shooting and Archery Sports Center and the Fujian provincial team came to her home to persuade Zhang Binbin to return to the provincial team. Like yesterday's game, she persisted and overcame the hurdles in her shooting career. "The way a coach decides who makes the team is different. However for me, I knew she was it when I saw Zhang Binbin's hands." Zhang Donhong also remembered that during the test in the training, despite her scores not being the best, her points were very consistent which was the reason the coaches were fond of Zhang Binbin. In the process of training Zhang Binbin, Zhang Yajie remembered clearly the input provided by this farm girl. He recalls that around 1 year after Zhang Binbin joined the Xiamen Shooting team, the team had a endurance training exercise where they were not allowed to move for half an hour. Zhang Xiaolong told the reporters that her daughter was always a quiet and obedient girl who liked to draw and play with homemade toys when she was small. "When I would sew and repair clothes at home, Binbin would use the scrap pieces and make a doll herself. She said that her daughter would often sew her own toys. As she also liked to draw, the facial expression and the clothes of the dolls she made looked really good. As an athlete, Zhang Binbin saw her family less and less, and would only go back home during the holidays, and usually contacted each other by phone. Her parents said that regardless of being together or on the phone, she would seldom talk about her hardship and would mostly talk about something happy with her parents. As they aren't able to see their daughter often, they make sure to carefully keep the drawings she made when she was little at home. Zhang Xiaolong showed a comic drawn by her daughter to the reporter and said "if she didn't become a shooter, she would have probably continued drawing." In the living room on the second floor of Zhang Binbin's house, there is a cupboard full of medals, and certificates she has won. Zhang Donghong arranged the medals neatly, and the certificates in a folder. “These are the result of Binbin's hard work in these 10 years and so, and are very precious to us."</div>
	<div class="translation" id="190">Xiamen girl Zhang Binbin: "beautiful hand" began shooting career path several "reversal" Zhang Donghong, of Dongyuan Village, Xiamen's Xiang'an District, just a few days ago replaced the 29-inch old TV in his home with a 65-inch one. <span class="highlighted">The daughter of an ordinary farmer is Zhang Binbin, who won the silver medal in the women's 50-meter rifle three-position final for China at the Rio Olympics on Monday night.</span> 11 Day and night, just in front of the new TV, the Zhang Donghong couple and dozens of relatives and close friends, together witnessed the daughter all the way to catch up, from almost the preliminary round was eliminated to almost a complete reversal of the magical process. In that day's competition, Zhang Binbin once ranked in the middle and lower reaches, seems to be very far away from the final. But the parents and friends did not give up, kept brushing the text live, see with the other players finished, Zhang Binbin all the way up the ranking, eventually locked up the final seat, his home immediately erupted from a burst of cheers. In the final, Zhang Binbin was once ranked in the situation, the last few shots more and more stable, only 0.2 ring behind the champion to win the silver medal. Zhang, now 27, has come close to winning the hard-won silver medal several times in his 16-year shooting career. Zhang Xiaolong, his mother, told reporters that just as they hesitated, Zhang Binbin sought several "novelists" from the same village. These "novelists" were children from the same village who had been recommended for training at the same time, including Zhang's cousin. Shortly after entering the Xiamen team, Zhang Binbin and once again because of family difficulties and other reasons, take the initiative to return to the school in Xiang'an. But after his enlightenment coach Zhang Yajie did the work repeatedly, Zhang Binbin returned to the Xiamen team. After entering the provincial team, Zhang Binbin and because of the delay into the national team, once because there was no hope and returned home again. This time, not only coach Zhang Yajie, Xiamen Shooting and Archery Sports Center and Fujian Province team leaders and coaches came to the home, and eventually persuaded Zhang Binbin to return to the provincial team. Just as yesterday's game, the Xiamen girl with the stick to achieve a shooting on the road to a reversal. "Every coach picks his players differently, and I saw that Benny's hands were so beautiful that I fell in love with him." Zhang Donghong also recalled that in the training test, his daughter, although not the best results, but hit the ring number is stable, which is an important reason for Zhang Binbin attracted coaches. In the process of training Zhang Binbin, Zhang Yajie was most impressed by the dedication of the peasant girl. He recalled that more than a year after Zhang Binbin entered the Xiamen Shooting Team, the team carried out a standing practice of raising a gun and asked the team members not to move for half an hour. Zhang Xiaolong told reporters that his daughter has been a quiet and well-behaved children, from an early age like painting and homemade hand-made toys, "Originally I would make clothes at home, sewing, Binbin will pick up some bits and pieces to make their own dolls." She says her daughter often sews her own handmade toys and, with her expertise in painting, makes everything from the doll's features to her clothes and accessories come to life. As an athlete, Zhang Binbin and his family gathered less and more, only the holidays to go home, usually by telephone contact. Parents said, whether it is to meet or call, Zhang Binbin rarely said their hard work, more with their parents to talk about something happy. Usually can not see his daughter, parents at home will be his daughter's childhood paintings as well as the honor of the calendar year are carefully preserved. Zhang showed his daughter's animated cartoon to reporters, "If she hadn't been a shooter, she should have continued to draw." And in the living room on the second floor of Zhang Binbin's home, there is a cupboard full of medals, medals and certificates she has received. Zhang Donghong neatly placed the medals and medals, certificates are unified into the folder preservation, "these are Binbin more than ten years of hard work in exchange for the honor, we all cherish."</div>
	<div class="translation" id="190">Zhang Binbin, a daughter of Xiamen, had "wonderful hand posture" and experienced multiple "reversals" during her career as a shooter. Zhang Donghong, a resident at Dongyuan Village at Xiang'an District in Xiamen, just swapped his old 29-inch television for a large 65-inch set several days ago. <span class="highlighted">This daughter of a common farmer is Zhang Binbin, who just won a silver medal for China in the 50 meter rifle three positions in the Rio Olympics.</span> During the evening of the 11th, Zhang Donghong, his wife, and dozens of other family members and friends stood before this new television and witnessed how his daughter started a miraculous spree that brought her from the brink of being dropped out of the competition to a medal winning score. On the day of the competition, Zhang Binbin had a mid to low ranking at one point, and a spot in the final appeared extremely remote. Parents, family, and friends did not give up, and continued to watch to live stream. When the other athletes completed their firing, Zhang Binbin's rank kept rising until she secured the right to compete in the finals. Everyone at her home exploded in a great cheer. In the finals, Zhang Binbin, who again fell behind in the rankings at one point, became increasingly steady as she fired the last few shots. She finished just 0.2 points behind the champion, clinching the silver medal. Across her 16-year shooting career, Zhang Binbin, who is 27-year old this year, brushed past this hard-won silver medal on several occasions. The mother, Zhang Xiaolong, told the reporter that when everyone was still hesitant, Zhang Binbin found several "young persuaders" from the same village. The "little lobbyists" are the kids from the same family participated the training by recommendation at hat time, including the cousin of Zhang Binbin. Not long after entering the Xiamen team, Zhang Binbin once again actively returned to study at a school in Xiang'an due to family difficulties and other reasons. Zhang Binbin returned to Xiamen Team after being repeatedly persuaded by her first coach Zhang Yajie. After joining the provincial team, Zhang Binbin, who took a long time to advance to the national team, returned home at one point because she saw no hope. This visit included more than just Coach Zhang Yajie. Official leaders and coaches from the Xiamen Shooting Shejian Sports Center and Fujian Provincial Team also came by and successfully persuaded Zhang Binbin to return to the provincial team. Just like the competition yesterday, this daughter of Xiamen persisted and once again turned the tables in her shooting career. "Every coach has different way of picking team members. At the time, I noticed that Binbin has really nice hands, and fell in love with them immediately." Zhang Donghong also recalled that although his daughter's performance was not the best at the group training test, the number of rounds she shot was very stable. This was also a key factor why Zhang Binbin attracted the attention of her coach. During training, the farm girl Zhang Binbin was so committed that she left a lasting impression with Zhang Yajie. He recollected that more than one year after Zhang Binbin joined the Xiamen shooting team, the team conducted a standing posture rifle firing training. Team members were required to stand still for half an hour. Zhang Xiaolong told the reporter that her daughter is a quiet and obedient child and has loved drawing and making her own toys since a young age. "Originally, I stayed at home to tailor some clothes, sewing and mending them as needed. Binbin would sit by the corner, collecting the scrap fabrics to make her own fabric doll." She said that her daughter would often sew and make her own toys. Coupled with the fact that she was good at drawing, she was able to create a lifelike face and clothing for the dolls she made. As an athlete, Zhang Binbin spends little time with family, and could only return home during weekends and public holidays. Usually, they communicate using the telephone. Her parents said that whether when meeting in person or talking on the phone, Zhang Binbin seldom said she found things difficult. More often than not, she would chat about happy things with parents. Since they hardly see their daughter, the parents carefully preserved the artwork that their girl has made as a child and the glories that she had later won. Zhang Xiaolong showed the reporter the cartoon artwork his daughter created. "If she didn't become a archer, she would probably continue to draw." There is a cabinet located at the second floor living room in Zhang Binbin's home that is filled with the plaques, medals, and certificates that she had won. Zhang Donghong displayed the medals and awards neatly, and kept all the certificates in a folder. "These are the honors Binbin has received over the years on the basis of her hard work and dedication. All of us cherish them."</div>

	<div class="translation" id="193">Although it hasn't been confirmed, numerous sources have said Apple's fall 2016 launch will take place in September, and the iPhone 7 is really coming. Apple didn't respond, but word has spread about the new iPhone's features and configuration, and even pictures of the iPhone 7's "real model" are available online. The next generation of iPhones is "eye-catching", hot, hot, rich and out of stock... If you want to buy the real thing for the first time, make sure you choose a good channel, say, Suning. <span class="highlighted">This added to the frustration over the new phone, "It lengthens, but it doesn't project a hologram at all! This generation of iPhones sucks."</span> The iPhone 7, like other iPhones, has been accompanied by countless secrets before it was born. Also, multiple sources have claimed that the new iPhone will eliminate the 3.5mm headphone jack and instead use a Bluetooth connection and charging jack, which would give Apple room to add a second speaker. Another piece of evidence to back up the news is that back in 2014 Apple allowed headphone makers to make headphone products that were connected through a charging interface. The news is either true or false, and the answer won't be revealed until Apple's autumn 2016 launch. But that doesn't detract from the industry's bullish outlook for the iPhone 7 - which many believe will most likely be Apple's last major upgrade to the iPhone family. Though the iPhone's market share has fallen, according to data released recently by market research firm IDC. Among them, Goldman Sachs maintained a "buy" rating on Apple's stock, while BMO analysts said the iPhone 7 would reap a historic sales performance. At the same time, Hock Tan, CEO of Broadcom, said it was likely that Apple would increase revenue by more than 20 percent in the future, thanks entirely to the launch of the iPhone 7. Seven percent of respondents said they planned to buy the iPhone 7, compared with just four percent two years ago. It is understood that 20 per cent of the current group of users who hold the iPhone 6 or 6Plus plan to buy the iPhone 7, which is a fairly high percentage. Second, there is expert analysis, most of the fruit powder like to replace their iPhone handsets from generation to generation. About 26 percent of all iPhone users have not changed their phone in two years, or nearly 120 million users have had their iPhone for two years, according to the report. Media captionTaiwan has been hit by several earthquakes during the production of the iPhone 7. "TSMC's production facilities have been damaged beyond imagination and could have an impact on the initial supply of the iPhone 7." Contradictions between supply and demand will affect ordinary users, it is time to choose a good channel, the first time low prices to start the genuine iPhone 7. According to people familiar with the matter, recently, Suning executives have been meeting with Apple frequently in order to prepare an adequate supply. The operator has already negotiated with Suning, and predictably, with the deep cooperation between the two sides, it is bound to bring lower prices and more intimate services to users. "At the lowest price, consumers might be able to buy an iPhone 7 for as little as $7 a day," he said. Sufficient supply and a variety of concessions, so that the purchase of the iPhone 7 is no longer "pressure mountain," and Suning's logistics, is to turn this beautiful into a more intuitive experience. Maybe you'll get a call in the middle of the night saying, "Hello, Suning EasyJet, your iPhone 7 is here."</div>
	<div class="translation" id="193">It has not yet been confirmed yet, but many sources have indicated that Apple's 2016 fall conference will be held in September. The iPhone 7 is really going to come out. Although Apple did not comment, information and specification of the new iPhone has been released and there are "actual" photos of the iPhone 7 on the web. The new generation of the iPhone is going to be slick, popular, and limited, thus if you want to be one of the first one to get a hold of it, be sure to know where to buy it from...like Suning. <span class="highlighted">"This has led to further disappointment in the new phone. It is longer but can't even take videos. This generation of iPhone is terrible."</span> Like the other iPhones, iPhone 7 had its share of secrets before being released. In addition, there are multiple sources claiming that the new generation of iPhone will not feature a 3.5mm headphone jack and use Bluetooth connectivity instead and will just have the charging port. This will provide space for Apple to add a second speaker. As evidence to backup this claim, Apple had developed earphones that would connect to the charging port back in 2014. Regardless of whether the rumors are true or not, we will only know for sure when it is announced in Apple's fall 2016 conference. However, this does not prevent the industry from looking at the potential specification of the iPhone 7 - many believe that the iPhone 7 will most likely be Apple's last major upgrade to the iPhone series. IDC, which is a market research institute recently released data that the market share of iPhone has declined. However, Goldman Sachs will maintain the "buy" rating for Apple's stock, and BMO analysts believe that iPhone7 will come together with a historic sales performance. Additionally, Broadcom’s CEO Hock Tan also stated that Apple’s future revenue growth may exceed 20%, all thanks to the launch of the iPhone 7. Seven percent of respondents said they had plans to purchase the iPhone 7, compared to only four percent who planned to purchase the iPhone 6 two years ago. It is understood that 20% of those currently using the iPhone 6 or 6 Plus plan to purchase the iPhone 7, which is a very high percentage. Also, experts analyzed that most of Apple consumers like to replace their iPhones every generation. According to the data, about 26% of all iPhone users have not changed their phones for 2 years. Which means almost 120 million people have used the iPhone for 2 years. Some media claimed that Taiwan faced several earthquakes during the production of iPhone 7 and, “The damage of TSMC's production facilities was bigger than expected and may affect the initial iPhone 7 supply.” The disparity between supply and demand will affect the average customers. It is time to choose a good place to buy an authentic iPhone 7 early at a lower price. According to informed sources, Suning executives met frequently with Apple in order to prepare enough stock. The company is already in discussion with Suning, and will inevitable provide a lower price and better service for consumers through a high-level of cooperation between the two parties. “At the lowest price, consumers may only need to pay 7 yuan a day to purchase the iPhone 7.” Plentiful stock and various services will make purchasing the iPhone less stressful. Through Suning's logistics, will further lead to a heightened buying experience. You may perhaps get a call in the middle of a night which will say "Hi this is Suning.com. Your iPhone 7 is here."</div>
	<div class="translation" id="193">Although it has yet to be proven, many information sources indicate that Apple will hold its 2016 Fall event in September. iPhone 7 is really on its way. Although Apple did not respond, news concerning the functions and configuration of the iPhone are being released gradually. Pictures of the "actual phone model" have even appeared on the Internet. The new iPhone could be considered a "public phenomenon". It's popular, sleek, and could not be acquired even if you have the money to pay for it. If you want to buy an original product, you must opt for a proper sales channel such as Suning. <span class="highlighted">This heightened the people's sense of disappointment for the new cellphone. "It became longer, but couldn't project holographs! This iPhone release sucks."</span> Like other iPhones, numerous anecdotes and secret information accompanied the iPhone 7 before its debut. Elsewhere, many sources of information also claimed that the 3.5mm headphone jack will be removed from the new iPhone to be replaced by bluetooth connection and the charging interface. This will give Apple room for adding a second speaker. Another piece of corroborative evidence is that as far back as 2014, Apple had already allowed headphone manufacturers to connect headphone products through the charging interface. The answer to such news, whether true or false, will only be revealed by Apple at the 2016 Fall launch event. This did not stop industry insiders from taking a positive view of the prospects of iPhone 7 however. Many believed that iPhone 7 could very well be the last time Apple would significantly upgrade the iPhone series. However, data recently published by IDC, a market intelligence firm, showed the market share of iPhone has decreased slightly. Goldman Sachs has rated Apple shares as something that can be "bought". BMO analysts believe that iPhone7 will establish a historical record in sales performance. Broadcom CEO Hock Tan also expressed that Apple is expected to achieve more than 20% growth in revenue. This figure can be completely attributed to the release of iPhone7. 7% of those interviewed said they intend to buy iPhone 7 compared to a mere 4% who planned to buy iPhone 6 two years ago. From information available, 20% of users currently holding an iPhone6 or 6Plus have plans for purchasing iPhone7. This proportion is quite substantial. Next, experts analyzed that most Apple fans like to replace their iPhone every other generation. Statistics revealed that among iPhone users, approximately 26% of users have not changed their mobile phones in two years, i.e., the iPhones of about 120 million users have been used for two years. Some media reported that Taiwan has been hit by several earthquakes during the iPhone7 production period. "Damages sustained by TSMC production facilities may have went beyond expectations, and that could have influenced initial supply for iPhone7." Supply and demand conflicts will influence normal users. It is time to select a proper channel and acquire an authentic iPhone7 early at a low price. Insider disclosure revealed that the upper management of Suning and Apple has met frequently in recent times for the purpose of preparing enough resources. Service operators have reached an agreement with Suning. It can be expected that with growing partnership between the two, users will be provided with lower prices and more dedicated services. " The lowest price. The customers might' only RMB 7 a day to get a iPhone7". Sufficient supply of goods and a variety of discounts, buyers of iPhone 7 will not be so stressed out, and Suning's logistics department will all the more turn this happiness into a more intuitive experience. Perhaps you will receive a phone call at midnight. "Hello, this is Suning.com. Your iPhone 7 has arrived."</div>

The scope of influence of online social networking has become increasingly widespread. Not only has it gradually replaced traditional phone communication, it has even permeated actual offline living circles, quietly changing the social activities of the masses. The benefit of online social networking is obvious. It is easy and convenient, and is therefore much preferred by younger demographics. A survey investigating college student socializing habits found that 57% of college students spend more than 5 hours a day on cellphones, literally making cellphones "inseparable" during everyday lives. "The characteristics of social networks include being low-cost, having fast transmission rates, and allowing many people to interact simultaneously. This suits the needs of contemporary university students. Expanded relationship circles, being able to chat on equal footing, and avoidance of social stigma are the main reasons why we become increasingly fond of online chat. The newcomers enjoy online communication with other employees, " because we are not familiar with each other at the beginning. But the 'like' and comment in the social media will close the distance." People who enjoy making friends also used online networking. "I haven't been contacting a friend for a while due to some misunderstanding. We then shared a few words in a larger group and things got better from there." IT engineer Wu Yan is strong fan for social networking, and spends most of his socializing time and life online, with many more online contacts than friends he meet offline. <span class="highlighted">Wu Yan himself honestly said that he feels like "fish returned to the water" when he goes online.</span> "You may reply to a friend when you are willing at a time that is convenient for you to do so because there is plenty of time for you to deliberate the wordings, and you can also express yourself more clearly." "The ID provides one with a cover to avoid all face-to-face interpersonal conflicts, providing one with more room to maneuver and also provided both sides with more time and space to think about what they say." "People of different status are given the same rights to speech and the same voice. Various social taboos in real life seem to disappear in the online world." Xiaopeng, a friend of Wu Yan, felt that the real life Wu Yan is a "boring geek". Xiaopeng and Wu Yan met in a big group. As they were both active speakers, they became acquainted very quickly. Xiaopeng felt that Wu Yan was completely different from his online personality. The real Wu Yan used little words and never gave any opinions. The only phrases he would use were: "Ho ho. Alright. Really?" or "I'll check that online."</div>

"You can stay behind your online ID and avoid face-to-face conflict; will have the peace of mind to think things out before taking action." "Two different people can come together and communicate at the same level. Thus the social concerns in real life seem to be non-existent online." However, Wu’s friend Xiaopeng thinks that Wu’s life is enclosed and abnormal. Xiaopeng and Wu Yan met in a large group and as they were both active talkers, they quickly became good friends. Xiaopeng felt that Wu Yan and two other people online were bland and did not actively express their opinions. Their replies were often "Oh, ok, really," or "Let me check online."</div>
