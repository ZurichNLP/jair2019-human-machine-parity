This form has never been attempted overseas. A foreign mission had once attempted to orbit and land but the landing failed.",
49,668,ifeng0812.news.49765603_0,火星探测涉及的技术领域非常多，特别之处还在于，虽然火星车是一个空间探测器，但与一般空间探测器相比，它又具有鲜明的特点。,"There are many technical fields involved in Mars exploration, and the special thing is that, although the Mars rover is a space probe, it has distinct characteristics compared with the general space probe.","Mars exploration covers a large number of technological fields. Despite being a space exploration device, the unique feature of the device is that it has distinctive characteristics that set it apart from general space exploration probes.",
49,669,ifeng0812.news.49765603_0,也就是说，火星探测器要具备确定行驶路线、发现障碍危险的能力。,"That is to say, the Mars rover should have the ability to determine the route and discover the danger of obstacles.","In other words, the Mars exploration vehicle must be given the ability to determine driving routes and detect obstacles and hazards.",
49,670,ifeng0812.news.49765603_0,中国航天科技集团五院研究员庞之浩说，人类之所以对火星探测如此青睐，是因为探测火星具有重要的科学、技术等多方面意义，甚至关系到人类的未来。,"Pang Zhihao, a researcher at the Fifth Academy of the China Aerospace Science and Technology Group, said that the reason why people are so interested in Mars exploration is because it has important scientific, technological and other significance, and even concerns the future of mankind.","Pang Zhihao, researcher at China Academy of Space Technology said that the reason why human beings are so keen to explore Mars is because it has major scientific, technological and various other significance, and is even related to the future of humanity.",
49,671,ifeng0812.news.49765603_0,目前火星已成为除地球以外人类研究程度最高的行星，人类利用空间探测器进行火星探测的历史几乎贯穿整个人类航天史。,"Mars has now become the planet with the highest degree of human research outside the Earth, and the history of human exploration of Mars using space probes runs through almost the entire history of human spaceflight.","Currently, Mars is the best-studied planet by the human race. The use of space probes for Mars exploration almost permeates the entirety of human aerospace history.",
49,672,ifeng0812.news.49765603_0,因此，人类希望有朝一日在火星建立居住基地，最终向火星移民，把它变成人类的第二家园。,"As a result, humanity hopes to one day establish a residential base on Mars, eventually migrating to it and turning it into a second home for humanity.","Hence, the human race hopes to construct a residential base on Mars in the future, colonize the planet, and make it a second home for the species.",
49,673,ifeng0812.news.49765603_0,大量迹象还表明，火星以前很可能与目前的地球一样，只是经过几十亿年的演化才变成大气层稀薄、温度较低、水源枯竭等样子。,"There are also plenty of indications that Mars, like Earth today, may have evolved over billions of years to become a thin atmosphere, cooler temperatures, depleted water sources, and so on.","Large volumes of evidence suggest that Mars, in the past, may be like present day earth, and only assumed its current form with thin atmosphere, low temperature, and dwindling water resources after an process of change lasting billions of years.",

49,682,ifeng0812.news.49765603_0,据中国航天科技集团公司五院总体部的火星探测器总设计师孙泽洲介绍，火星探测任务面临着许多技术挑战。,"The Mars exploration mission faces many technical challenges, according to Sun Zezhou, chief architect of the Mars rover in the general department of the Fifth Academy of the China Aerospace Science and Technology Corporation.","According to Sun Zezhou, chief designer of the Mars exploration vehicle at the integrated department of facility 5 of the China Aerospace Science and Technology Corporation, the Mars exploration mission faces many technical challenges.",
49,683,ifeng0812.news.49765603_0,火星大气气压很低，只有地球表面大气压力的1%，具有很高的不确定性。,"Mars has a very low atmospheric pressure, only 1% of the atmospheric pressure on the Earth's surface, with a high degree of uncertainty.","The atmospheric pressure on Mars, at only 1% that on Earth, has significant uncertainties.",
49,684,ifeng0812.news.49765603_0,有关它的变化和风暴时特性等因素，科学家们还没有透彻的认识。,Scientists do not yet have a thorough understanding of factors such as its variability and storm-time characteristics.,"Scientists have yet to arrive at a clear understanding about its changes, the properties of the storms, and other functions.",
49,685,ifeng0812.news.49765603_0,火星在夏季常形成类似地球沙尘天气的尘暴，这会导致火星车接收的太阳光能量急剧下降，必须为火星车设计“休眠”模式，让其耐心地等待尘暴过去。,"Mars often forms dust storms in the summer that resemble the dust of the Earth, causing a sharp drop in the sun's energy received by the rover, which must be designed to ""sleep"" in order to patiently wait for the dust storm to pass.","As Mars experiences sand storms familiar with those on the earth, the rover will not receive enough solar energy for operation. Therefore, it has to have a "" Sleeping"" mode till the end of the storm.",
49,686,ifeng0812.news.49765603_0,同时，火星大气对太阳光照还有削减作用，这为火星探测的能源供给带来难题。,"At the same time, the Martian atmosphere has a diminishing effect on solar light, which poses a problem for the energy supply for Mars exploration.","The atmosphere of Mars will also weaken incoming solar radiation, providing yet another challenge to power supply for Mars exploration.",
49,687,ifeng0812.news.49765603_0,这就要求探测器的太阳翼面积更大，而且需不断调整，努力对准太阳方向。,This requires that the probe's solar wing area is larger and needs to be constantly adjusted in an effort to align with the direction of the sun.,This requires the probe to have larger solar panels that must be constantly adjusted to direct them towards the sun.,
49,688,ifeng0812.news.49765603_0,还有，火星表面重力只有地球的38%，但是比月球表面的重力大多了，因此探测器需要更大的功率。,"Also, the surface gravity of Mars is only 38% of that of Earth, but it is much greater than that of the lunar surface, so the probe needs more power.","In addition, the surface gravity on Mars is only 38% that of Earth, but is a lot larger than that on the Moon.

49,689,ifeng0812.news.49765603_0,“这次火星探测任务最核心、最难的地方，就是探测器进入火星大气后气动外形和降落伞减速的过程，只有一次机会，必须确保成功。”,"""The most central and most difficult part of this mission is the aerodynamic shape and parachute deceleration of the spacecraft as it enters the Martian atmosphere.","""The most central and hardest part of this Mars exploration mission is the aerodynamic configuration and the parachute deceleration process after the probe enters the atmosphere of Mars. There is only one opportunity, and ensuring its success is critical.""",
49,690,ifeng0812.news.49765603_0,孙泽洲说，由于地球与火星距离遥远，整个过程无法由地面实时控制，所以必须依靠探测器自主完成。,"Sun said the whole process could not be controlled by the ground in real time because of the distance between the Earth and Mars, so it had to be done autonomously by the rover.","Sun Zezhou said that as Earth was a long distance away from Mars, it was impossible to control the entire process on a real-time basis. Therefore, a probe is required to complete the mission autonomously.",
49,691,ifeng0812.news.49765603_0,由于没有那么多的推进剂来抵消那么高的速度，所以登陆火星时，减速要依靠火星大气的作用，然而火星大气难以在地面模拟。,"Since there are not so many propellants to offset that high velocity, the deceleration upon landing on Mars depends on the action of the Martian atmosphere, which is difficult to simulate on the ground.","As there was insufficient propellant to offset such a high speed, when landing on Mars, deceleration would depend on the effect of the Martian atmosphere. The atmosphere on Mars however, is difficult to simulate on Earth.",
49,692,ifeng0812.news.49765603_0,庞之浩说，总体来讲，探测火星的方式与探测月球的方式相似，也是“绕、落、巡、回”，最终实现载人登陆火星的目标。,"In general, the way to explore Mars is similar to the way to explore the moon, Pang said, and is also to ""circle, fall, patrol, and return,"" ultimately achieving the goal of a manned landing on Mars.","Pang Zhihao said, ""On the whole, the methods used to explore Mars and the Moon are similar. It also involves ""orbit, land, inspect, return"", ultimately achieving the goal of bringing people to Mars.",
49,693,ifeng0812.news.49765603_0,由于火星距离地球比月球距离地球要远得多，所以探测火星需要攻克一系列更复杂的技术难关。,"Because Mars is much farther away from Earth than the Moon is from Earth, exploring Mars will require tackling a series of more complex technical hurdles.","As Mars is further away from Earth than the Moon, exploring Mars requires overcoming a series of more complex technical difficulties.",

50,699,ifeng0812.news.49765646_0,詹启贤认为，今天只要还有党产，没有人会给你社会捐款，若党产统统被充公收走，国民党刚好可请求社会支持与赞助，“今天真的没有了才有机会去要”。,"Jen Chih-hsien believes that as long as there are still party properties today, no one will give you social donations. If all party properties are confiscated and taken away, the Kuomintang can just ask for social support and sponsorship.","Steve Chan believed that as long as party assets exist today, no one will give public donations.
