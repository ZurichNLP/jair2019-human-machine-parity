76,"升级改造后的京杭大运河支线航道老万福河、北大溜航道9月1日起收取通行费。
这两条支流航道采取社会融资方式进行改造建设,收费已获省政府相关部门批准。
老万福河航道流经金乡、鱼台,经南阳湖进入京杭大运河主航道,全长32.5公里。
根据通航需要,老万福河航道采取养护改造的方式,对局部水深进行了浚深,局部急弯进行裁弯取直等,通航条件得以改善。
该航道流经金乡县、任城区,经南阳湖进入京杭大运河主航道,全长19公里。
两条航道的改造工程于2011年2月开工建设,2015年1月完成交工验收,投资建设和运营主体为济宁市安平运河物流服务中心。
按照“贷款建设、收费还贷”的原则,济宁市安平运河物流服务中心依据山东省物价局批复的收费标准征收航道通行费。
其中,基础通行费按1.75元/载重吨计收,里程通行费按0.05元/公里载重吨计收。
通行费征收时间自2016年6月15日起至2019年6月14日止。
记者从济宁市港航局了解到,目前济宁境内共有4条收费航道,分别为洙水河航道、白马河航道、北大溜航道、老万福河航道。
4条航道为京杭大运河的支流航道,均采取社会融资的方式进行升级改造。
洙水河航道升级改造工程是第一个采用“政府+市场”的模式,用于山东省内河港航基础设施建设的项目,政府占主体投资,社会资金补充资金缺口。
白马河、老万福河、北大溜河等支线航道采取的是纯市场化运作的方式。
国家财政拨付的资金不能满足工程建设的需要,制约着航道升级的进度。
社会资金用于公共基础设施的建设符合国家政策的要求,也成为破解资金瓶颈的途径。",657,"Toll collection started on September 1 for the Laowanfu River and Beidaliu navigation channels after their upgrades and reconstruction. These navigation channels are part of the Grand Canal. 
The costs for the upgrades and reconstruction for these two will be covered with social financing, and the costs have been approved by the appropriate departments of the provincial government. 
The Laowanfu River passes through Jinxiang and Yutai before linking with the Grand Canal through Nanyang Lake. Laowanfu River is a total of 32.5 kilometers.
According to navigation requirements, the Laowanfu River waterway will need to adopt a proper maintenance method, deepen the water level, and straighten the channel, to improve the navigation conditions. 
The waterway that goes through Jinxiang County and Rencheng District which then enters the main navigation channel of the Grand Canal via Nanyang Lake is 19 kilometers long.
The work on the two channels started in February 2011 and was completed in January 2015. The principal for the investment and construction was by the Jining City Anping Canal Logistics Service Center.
Based on the “paying off loans with a service fee” principle, the Anping Canal Logistics Service Center of Jining City will collect toll fees subject to the standards approved by the Shandong Provincial Price Bureau.
One of such standard is the base toll calculated at 1.75 yuan/dwt, and a toll mileage of 0.05 yuan/km dwt.
The toll collection period is from June 15, 2016 to June 14th, 2019.
Reporters learned from the Jining City Port and Navigation Bureau that there are currently 4 tolled waterway in Jining consisting of Weishui River, Baima River, Beidake River, and Laowanfu River.
The 4 waterways are tributaries of the Grand Canal and were upgraded via social financing.
The Weishui River upgrade project was the first to feature the collaborative ""Government + Market"" model for waterway improvement in the Shangdong Province. The Government funded most of it while social funding was used to cover the balance.
Baima River, Laowanfu River and Beidake River projects were done purely for the interest of the market.
The budget allocated from the state finance is not enough to cover the cost of the project construction, and would impede on the upgrade progress of the channels.
The use of social funding for the construction of public infrastructure meets the requirements of national policies and has also become a way to overcome funding issues."

64,"格雷西亚是一只萌萌的雌性巨嘴鸟，浑身散发着热带雨林的气息。
在中美洲国家哥斯达黎加，巨嘴鸟格雷西亚和它的故事早已家喻户晓。
8月10日的新闻发布会上，术后康复的格雷西亚终于亮相，向人们展示它崭新的3D打印塑料鸟喙。
这只一年半前被人折断上喙、奄奄一息的巨嘴鸟，如今终于重获新生。
这一天不仅宣告着它已100%恢复健康，更是它搬进豪华鸟舍、与关心它的人类朋友们见面的日子。
初进新家的格雷西亚稍显腼腆，但不多时就变得活泼起来，在水盆里打滚嬉闹，用新喙吃葡萄。
为了提醒人们它曾经遭受的伤害，技术人员没有给它的新喙上色，而是保留了3D打印材料原有的白色。
鸟喙外是一层薄薄的角质鞘，里面中空，只有一些细细的骨质支撑杆交错排列。
虽然有这种内部加固成份，巨嘴鸟的喙还是脆弱，受到伤害时会破碎。
动物救助中心、鸟类学家和一家美国3D打印公司通力合作，为格雷西亚制作了好几个“试验喙”，终于造出最适合它的“完美喙”。
如今格雷西亚已能熟练使用新喙喝水、吃东西，甚至啄起细小谷粒。
“最终成品的设计花了大约2个月，打印出来只需4、5个小时。”
“3D打印并不是未来技术，它已经实实在在走进了你我的生活。”美国SG3D打印公司董事长托马斯·朗格在接受新华国际记者采访时说。
2015年1月，在哥斯达黎加中部阿拉胡埃拉省格雷西亚的一个农场，浑身是血的巨嘴鸟格雷西亚被人发现。
当时它的上喙被一伙年轻人残忍折断，它完全无法进食，生命垂危。
格雷西亚的惨状经媒体报道后，在哥斯达黎加内外引起如潮的反对虐待动物呼声。
人们要求设立更为严格的动物保护法、加大对虐待者的惩罚力度。
人们自发前来，尽最大努力帮助格雷西亚尽可能恢复受伤前的生活。
甚至3D打印技术发明人查克·赫尔也参与到格雷西亚上喙的设计中来。
“格雷西亚的情况很特殊，它的上喙剩余部分不足1厘米，所以给安装新喙带来许多困难。”
“我们先对格雷西亚扫描，然后设计、制作出一个稍长于它上喙剩余部分的延长假体，用粘胶固定在它的上喙上。”
“这样可以减少对格雷西亚造成进一步侵入性伤害。”朗格对新华国际记者说。
在安装假体之前，工作人员每天都要为格雷西亚清理断喙，以防感染。
远在千里之外，巨嘴鸟格雷西亚的故事感动了著名纪录片导演葆拉·埃雷迪亚和探索新闻频道制片人约翰·霍夫曼。
他们记录下格雷西亚安装新喙过程中的点点滴滴，录制了一部纪录片《巨嘴鸟之国》，已于本月在动物星球频道上播放。
纪录片《巨嘴鸟之国》向人们展示，一只小小的巨嘴鸟是如何让一个国家为之改变、如何让国民都参与到反对虐待动物当中来。",1066,"Grecia is an adorable female toucan that exudes a tropical feel.
The story of Grecia the toucan has been known early on in the Central American country of Costa Rica.
In the press release on August 30th, Grecia who recovered from the surgery showed off her new prosthetic 3D printed beak to the public.
The toucan whose beak was hacked off by humans and was dying a year and half ago is now reborn.
This day not only confirms that she is 100% healthy, but also is a day when she will be relocated to a luxurious cage and a day for those who care about her to be able to see her.
Grecia was a bit shy after moving to her new home but became more lively as she played in the water and ate grapes with her new beak.
The engineering specialist did not newly paint the 3D printed beak to serve as a reminder to people of what she went through, thus leaving it in the original white color of the 3D printing material.
The outer layer of the beak features a thin wall of keratin, and the inside is generally hollow and is only supported by several thin bone struts.
Despite the interior being reinforced, the toucan's beak is still frail and can break when damaged.
With the collaboration with the animal rescue center, bird specialists, and a US 3D printing company, the group was able to create several ""trial versions"" to identify and finally create ""the perfect one"".
Grecia can now skillfully use her new beak to drink water, eat, and even pick up small grains.
""The design of the final product took around 2 months and the printing only took 4-5 hours.""
The president of SG3D Printing, Thomas Lange explained to Xinhua International during an interview that, ""3D printing is not a technology of the future but has already stepped in to our lives"".
In January 2015, a bloodied toucan (Grecia) was found on a farm in Grecia, Alajuela Province located in central Costa Rica.
The beak was brutally hacked off by a group of youngsters. She could not eat at all and was in critical condition.
After the media covered the story of Grecia's tragic situation, it triggered a wave of opposition on animal cruelty in and outside of Costa Rica.
People have since called out for a stricter animal protection law and for harsher penalties for animal abuse.
People proactively came together to do their best to help Grecia recover and regain her life before being injured.
Chuck Hall who is the inventor of 3D printing was also involved in the design of Grecia's beak.
""Grecia's situation was a very special one as there was less than 1 cm of the upper jaw left, which caused many difficulties in attaching the beak.""
""We first scanned Grecia then designed an extended cap that was a bit longer than the remnant beak, then glued the prosthetic beak"".
Lange told the reporters of Xinhua International that ""By doing so, we can prevent further injury for Grecia"".
Before installing the prosthetic beak, the staff had to keep Grecia clean everyday to prevent infections.
The story of Grecia the toucan travelled the distance and touched John Hoffman who is a producer at Discovery News Channel and Paul Heredia who is a famous documentary director.
They filmed bits and pieces of the installation of Grecia's new beak to make a documentary called ""Toucan Nation"" which was aired on Animal Planet this month.
The documentary ""Toucan Nation"" shows how a small Toucan inspired a nation to make changes and citizens to get involved to stop animal cruelty."

紫外线不仅让同学们的皮肤变黑，更加会晒伤肌肤，如何让肌肤能顺利度过军训，不被晒伤？
防晒霜包装上一般都标有SPF和PA，SPF是指防晒指数，是针对UVB紫外线的，我们常见的SPF指数有15、30、50等。
标有PA的产品是针对UVA的，这样防晒品会发挥更加有效的作用，通常情况下，PA的强度用+来表示，多一个+表示有效防护时间延长。
油性肌肤应选择渗透力较强的水性防晒用品，防晒喷雾也是不错的选择。
干性肌肤应选择霜状的防晒用品;中性皮肤一般无严格规定，敏感性肌肤擦上任何保养品都是一种负担，建议选纯物理性防晒产品。
切记提前半小时涂防晒霜，因为防晒产品需要时间才能完全渗入到皮肤。
军训日晒时间较长，防晒霜每隔两小时擦一次才能有持久效果，千万不要偷懒。
由于皮肤刚受到日晒刺激的缘故，军训回来不要立刻用美白产品。

UV rays not only darkens your skin but can also cause sunburn. So how does one get through the rigorous military training without sunburn?
Sunscreen generally features a SPF and PA mark. SPF is the measure of how well a sunscreen protects the skin from sunburn, and protect the skin from UVB rays. The common figures we see are SPF of 15, 30 and 50.
Products with the PA mark is for UVA rays thus is a more effective sun screen. The strength of the PA is shown with + signs, and any additional + signs represents longer protection time.
Those with oily skin should choose water-based sunscreen for deep protection. Sunscreen spray is also a good choice.
Those with dry skin should use sunscreen cream and those with neutral skin are not bound with any rules. Any type of skin care products is not good for those with sensitive skin and a 100% pure sunscreen is recommended.
It takes time for the sunscreen to seep in thus do not forget to apply the sunscreen 30 minutes beforehand.
During the long military training, be sure to apply sunscreen once every two hours to keep it effective. Don't get lazy.
The skin is exposed greatly to the sun during military training thus do not use skin whitening products right away.
After military training, if possible, wrap ice cubes with a towel and apply it to your burnt skin to cool it down."

此次即将完成的交易首单也预示着青岛排污权交易试点工作正式拉开序幕,这也将是全省排污权交易首单和全国城市级排污权交易首单。
11日上午,青岛双桃精细化工(集团)有限公司总经理赵秀平来到青岛市排污权交易中心提交排污权申购。
该企业位于青岛老城区的厂区去年年底全面停产,环保搬迁至平度的新厂区。
赵秀平提交了申请表、建设项目环境影响报告书等材料后,青岛市排污权储备和交易服务中心开始对申请材料进行初审。
根据青岛市物价、财政等部门确定的征收标准,目前预估算的初始排污权使用费约为64.12万元,工作人员将在7个工作日内完成核定。
此次即将完成的交易首单也预示着青岛排污权交易试点工作正式拉开序幕,也将是全省排污权交易首单和全国城市级排污权交易首单。
赵秀平说,目前企业环保已投资达4个亿,表面上数额巨大,但对企业经营管理理念、社会效益都有很大影响,对企业创新管理也开辟了空间。
当天,青岛四方新诚志卓客车配件有限公司也来为年产4200件高铁及动车组内饰配件项目申购排污权。
该项目属于机械加工企业,申请的初始排污权为化学需氧量(COD)0.514吨/年、氨氮(NOX)0.052吨/年。
大气污染物排污权有偿使用和交易为全市电力、热力生产供应重点工业企业。
2016年1月1日前已取得环评的现有排污单位,暂不征收有偿使用费。
“有偿获得排污权并不等于获得了违法排污的权力,并不能随意地排放污染物。”
青岛市环保局副局长汉红燕介绍,如果违法排污、超标排污仍然要按照相关的法规予以处罚,不可能允许违法企业通过购买排污权的方式来规避处罚。
也就是说,通过法律手段严厉打击环境违法行为,严惩企业的超标排污行为,从而保护环境,保障公众健康。
现在企业为了自身的利益,提高了治污的积极性,珍惜有限的排污权,减少了污染物排放。
有了经济利益的驱动,减少污染物的排放就从政府的强制行为变为企业自觉的市场行为,从而真正达到保护环境、保护自然、保障公众健康的目的。
排污权又称“排放权”,是排放污染物的权利,指排放者在政府分配的额度内,依法享有的向环境排放污染物的权利。
这种权利实质上是排污者对环境容量资源占有、使用和收益的权利。
下一步,在污染物排放总量不超过允许排放量的前提下,内部各污染源之间通过货币交换的方式相互调剂排污量。
排污权交易自1968年由美国经济学家戴尔斯提出以来,20世纪70年代开始美国将其应用于大气及河流污染源的管理。

On the morning of the 11th, Zhao Xiuping, the president of Qingdao Shuangtao Jingxi Chemical Industry (Group) Limited Company, came to the Qingdao Emissions Trading Center to submit an application to purchase an emission permit.
The same company had a plant in Qingdao's old town but was shut down last year and relocated to Pingdu for environmental concerns.
After Zhao Xiuping submitted the construction and environmental assessment permit application, the Qingdao Emissions Trading Center started to do a preliminary review of the submitted application.
The estimated initial emission fee is approximately 641,200 yuan according to the collection standards set by Qingdao Pricing Administration. The staff will process and verify it within 7 business days.
The first trading done represents that the carbon emission trading pilot program has officially started, and will be the first in the province to introduce the emission trading scheme at the city-level.
Zhao Xiuping mentioned that he has invested RMB 400 million on corporate environmental responsibility. Despite being a large amount of money put into this, it greatly impacts the company's philosophy, social responsibility, and also opens up a new level of innovation management.
On the same day, Qingdao Sifang Xincheng Zhizhuo Coach Parts Co., Ltd. also came to purchase emission permits for their annual production of 4,200 pieces of high-speed rail and EMU (Electrical Multiple Unit) interior parts.
This project was for the machining companies, with initial emission amount of 0.514 ton/yr of COD, and 0.052 ton/yr of NOX on their application.
The carbon emission trading is an important business to support electricity and heat for the city.
The carbon credits obtained from EIA before January 1, 2016 will not be charged with the usage fee for the time being.
""Purchasing an emission permit does not grant permission to freely discharge illegal pollutants.""
Han Hongyan, the Deputy Director of the Environmental Protection Bureau of Qingdao stated the those who discharge illegal pollutants and excessive pollutants will still be punished according to the regulation; those discharging illegal discharge of pollutants and excessive discharge of pollutants will still have to be punished in accordance with relevant regulations, and companies will not be able to purchase emission permits to avoid punishment for illegal or excessive discharges.
Basically, through legal measures and being stringent on environmental violations and to punish companies for excessive discharges, we will be able to protect the environment and the health of the public.
Companies have now put their focus on managing emissions for their own benefit and appreciate limiting the emission amount which has lead to a reduction of pollutants being discharged.
With the economic benefits being a factor, the government's bold action has lead to company's to react to take action on reducing emissions. This will all lead to protecting the environment, nature, and the health of the public.
The right to emit pollutants, also known as “emissions permit”. It refers to the right of emitters to discharge pollutants to the environment within the limits allocated by the government.
This type of right limits the footprint of the polluters in the environment and a right to gain revenue.
The next step, assuming that the discharged pollutant does not exceed the limit is to control the emission amount  through carbon emission trading.
Emissions trading was proposed by American economist John Dales back in 1968. Since the 1970s in the 20th Century, the United States has applied it to control pollution in the atmosphere and river.
China has been doing trials since 2007, and has implemented it in 14 provinces (in regions and cities) including Zhejiang and Jiangsu."

Using calcified tissue to measure age is the traditional method and fins can be used with some sharks. However the calcified tissue is very rare in Greenland sharks.
A new study led by Julius Nilsson of the University of Copenhagen in Denmark looked at radiocarbon dating of the eye lens of the Greenland Shark.

Their study shows that the life of the largest shark is estimated to be 392 years old and with a deviation of 120 years old.
This means that the oldest shark is at least 272 years old and could be as old as 512 years old.
In addition, the female Greenland shark is said to be ready to mate when it is about 4 meters in length, which equates to an age of at least 156 before reaching adulthood.

虽然苹果公司并未回应，但有关新iPhone的功能、配置已经陆续有消息放出，甚至网上连iPhone7“真机模型”图片都有了。
新一代iPhone可谓“万众瞩目”，火热、紧俏、有钱无货……如果你想第一时间购买到正品，一定要选择一个好渠道，比如说，苏宁。
这加剧了人们对于新手机的失望，“它加长了，却根本不能投射全息图像!这一代iPhone糟透了。”
iPhone7像其他iPhone一样，出生之前就伴随着无数秘闻。
另外，还有多个消息源声称，新一代iPhone将取消3.5mm耳机接口，转而使用蓝牙连接和充电接口，这将为苹果增加第二个扬声器提供空间。
能佐证这一消息的另一证据是，早在2014年苹果就允许耳机厂商生产通过充电接口连接的耳机产品。
这些消息或真或假，答案直到苹果2016秋季发布会才能揭晓。
但这并不妨碍业内人士看好iPhone7的前景——许多人认为，iPhone7将很有可能成为苹果对iPhone系列的最后一次大幅升级。

However, this does not prevent the industry from looking at the potential specification of the iPhone 7 - many believe that the iPhone 7 will most likely be Apple's last major upgrade to the iPhone series.
IDC, which is a market research institute recently released data that the market share of iPhone has declined.
However, Goldman Sachs will maintain the ""buy"" rating for Apple's stock, and BMO analysts believe that iPhone7 will come together with a historic sales performance.
Additionally, Broadcom’s CEO Hock Tan also stated that Apple’s future revenue growth may exceed 20%, all thanks to the launch of the iPhone 7.
Seven percent of respondents said they had plans to purchase the iPhone 7, compared to only four percent who planned to purchase the iPhone 6 two years ago.
It is understood that 20% of those currently using the iPhone 6 or 6 Plus plan to purchase the iPhone 7, which is a very high percentage.
Also, experts analyzed that most of Apple consumers like to replace their iPhones every generation.
According to the data, about 26% of all iPhone users have not changed their phones for 2 years. Which means almost 120 million people have used the iPhone for 2 years.
Some media claimed that Taiwan faced several earthquakes during the production of iPhone 7 and, “The damage of TSMC's production facilities was bigger than expected and may affect the initial iPhone 7 supply.”
The disparity between supply and demand will affect the average customers. It is time to choose a good place to buy an authentic iPhone 7 early at a lower price.
According to informed sources, Suning executives met frequently with Apple in order to prepare enough stock.
The company is already in discussion with Suning, and will inevitable provide a lower price and better service for consumers through a high-level of cooperation between the two parties.
“At the lowest price, consumers may only need to pay 7 yuan a day to purchase the iPhone 7.”
Plentiful stock and various services will make purchasing the iPhone less stressful. Through Suning's logistics, will further lead to a heightened buying experience.
You may perhaps get a call in the middle of a night which will say ""Hi this is Suning.com. Your iPhone 7 is here."""

42,"厦门姑娘张彬彬：“手型漂亮”开始射击之路职业生涯几经“逆转”
厦门翔安区东园村的张东红前几天刚把家中29寸的老电视，换成了65寸的大电视。
这位普通农民的女儿，就是11日晚为中国斩获里约奥运会女子50米步枪三姿决赛银牌的张彬彬。
11日夜，就在这部新电视前，张东红夫妇和几十位亲戚好友，一起见证了女儿一路奋起直追，从几乎预赛就被淘汰到差点大逆转的神奇过程。
在当日的比赛中，张彬彬一度排名中下游，似乎距离决赛十分遥远。
但父母和亲朋好友没有放弃，不停地刷着文字直播，看到随着其他选手完赛，张彬彬名次一路提升，最终锁定决赛席位，其家中顿时爆发从一阵欢呼。
决赛中，张彬彬又是在一度排名靠后的情况下，最后几枪越打越稳，仅以落后冠军0.2环成绩夺得银牌。
今年已经27岁的张彬彬，在16年的射击生涯中，其实有几度都差点与这块来之不易的银牌擦身而过。
其母张小龙告诉记者，就在他们犹豫时，张彬彬找来了同村的几个“小说客”。
这些“小说客”是当年同时被推荐参加集训的同村小孩，其中还有张彬彬的表姐。
就在进入厦门队后不久，张彬彬又一度因为家庭困难等原因，主动回到翔安的学校读书。
但是在其启蒙教练张亚杰反复做工作后，张彬彬又回到了厦门队。
而进入省队后，张彬彬又曾因为迟迟进不了国家队，一度因为看不到希望而再度回到家里。
这次，不仅张亚杰教练，厦门射击射箭运动中心和福建省队的领导和教练都来到家里，最终劝说张彬彬回到省队。
就如同昨天的比赛，这位厦门姑娘的用坚持实现了射击之路上的一个个逆转。
“每个教练挑选队员的方法不一样，当时我看到彬彬的手长得很漂亮，就一下子相中了。”
张东红也回忆，在集训测试中，女儿虽然成绩不是最好，但打出的环数很稳定，这也是张彬彬吸引教练的重要原因。
在训练张彬彬的过程中，张亚杰印象最深的，则是这位农家女孩的投入。
他回忆说，张彬彬进入厦门射击队一年后多，队里进行立射的持久举枪训练，要求队员半个小时不能动。
张小龙告诉记者，女儿一直是个安静乖巧的孩子，从小就喜欢画画和自制手工玩具，
“原来我会在家里做做衣服、缝缝补补，彬彬就会捡一些边角料自己做娃娃。”
她说，女儿常常会自己缝制手工玩具，加上她擅长画画，从娃娃的五官到衣饰，总能做得栩栩如生。
作为运动员，张彬彬和家人聚少离多，只有节假日才能回家，平时多靠电话联系。
父母说，无论是见面还是打电话，张彬彬很少说自己的辛苦，更多的是跟父母聊些开心的事。
平时见不到女儿，父母在家中将女儿小时候的画作以及历年的荣誉都细心收存着。
张小龙将女儿的动漫画作展示给记者，“如果没有当射击运动员，她应该还会继续画画”。
而在张彬彬家二楼客厅，有一个柜子内放满了她所获得的奖章、奖牌和证书。
张东红将奖牌和奖章整齐摆放，证书则统一放进了文件夹保存，“这些都是彬彬十几年心血换来的荣誉，我们都很珍惜。”",1180,"The Young Zhang Binbin from Xiamen: She started her shooting career as she had ""Beautiful Hands"" and went through various ""struggles"".
Zhang Donghong from Dongyuan Village in Xiang'an District of Xiamen just replaced an old 29-inch TV with a 65-inch TV at his home.
This average farmer's daughter is Zhang Binbin who won the silver medal in the 50 meter rifle three positions event at the Rio Olympic Games for China on the evening of the 11th.
Zhang Donghong and his wife along with a number of friends and family were in front of the new TV on the night of the 11th to witness their daughter make a miraculous comeback from almost being eliminated
In the day of the event, Zhang Binbin was at one point in the lower part of the ranking and did not seem she would reach the finals.
However her parents and close friends did not give up on her as they kept their eyes on the text of the broadcast. Upon seeing other players finishing and where they were ranked, they saw Binbin's name go up the rank and secured a seat in the finals, when the families and friends burst in cheers at home.
In the finals, she was on the bottom end of the ranking but her last few shots got more stable and won the silver medal with only 0.2 points behind the champion.
For Zhang Binbin who is already 27, it was a hard-fought silver medal in her 16 years of her shooting career.
Zhang's mother, Xiaolong told the reporters that when they felt hesitant about her doing this, Zhang Binbin brought a group of ""young kids"" from the same village to persuade her parents.
The ""young kids"" were from the same village who were also recommended to participate in the training at the same time. Among them was Zhang Binbin's cousin.
However, shortly after joining the Xiamen team, Zhang Binbin decided to go back to school in Xiang'an to study due to family hardships.
But after the coach Zhang Yajie, kept convincing her, she returned to the Xiamen team again.
After being in the provincial team, Zhang Binbin once again failed to get in the national team. As she could not see hope in getting in, she returned home once again.
This time, not only coach Zhang, but also the managers and coaches of the Xiamen Shooting and Archery Sports Center and the Fujian provincial team came to her home to persuade Zhang Binbin to return to the provincial team.
Like yesterday's game, she persisted and overcame the hurdles in her shooting career.
""The way a coach decides who makes the team is different. However for me, I knew she was it when I saw Zhang Binbin's hands.""
Zhang Donhong also remembered that during the test in the training, despite her scores not being the best, her points were very consistent which was the reason the coaches were fond of Zhang Binbin.
In the process of training Zhang Binbin, Zhang Yajie remembered clearly the input provided by this farm girl.
He recalls that around 1 year after Zhang Binbin joined the Xiamen Shooting team, the team had a endurance training exercise where they were not allowed to move for half an hour.
Zhang Xiaolong told the reporters that her daughter was always a quiet and obedient girl who liked to draw and play with homemade toys when she was small.
""When I would sew and repair clothes at home, Binbin would use the scrap pieces and make a doll herself.
She said that her daughter would often sew her own toys. As she also liked to draw, the facial expression and the clothes of the dolls she made looked really good.
As an athlete, Zhang Binbin saw her family less and less, and would only go back home during the holidays, and usually contacted each other by phone.
Her parents said that regardless of being together or on the phone, she would seldom talk about her hardship and would mostly talk about something happy with her parents.
As they aren't able to see their daughter often, they make sure to carefully keep the drawings she made when she was little at home.
Zhang Xiaolong showed a comic drawn by her daughter to the reporter and said ""if she didn't become a shooter, she would have probably continued drawing.""
In the living room on the second floor of Zhang Binbin's house, there is a cupboard full of medals, and certificates she has won.
Zhang Donghong arranged the medals neatly, and the certificates in a folder. “These are the result of Binbin's hard work in these 10 years and so, and are very precious to us."""

106,"很多NBA球员都证明了自己的实力。但是有人进步就有人衰落。
无论是因为年龄的增大还是出场时间被限制，每个赛季都有一些球员的表现会出现退步。
当然了，有些“退步”可能仅仅是数据的缩水，这些球员的实力可能并未下降。
即便韦德仍是联盟里最好的得分后卫之一，但是他在公牛的表现应该不会有热火那么好了。
他和隆多组成的后场射程有限，当家球星巴特勒的三分命中率也只有32.8%，这让他们下赛季的进攻会打得很拥挤。
来到了风城，闪电侠势必把球权更多地让给巴特勒和隆多，自己很可能在常规赛选择养生打法。
奥卡福的情况比较尴尬，作为上赛季76人的第一选择，他在新赛季不得不和西蒙斯以及恩比德竞争上场时间和球权。
这一竞争可能不会来的很快，西蒙斯还需要适应NBA赛场，恩比德也要尽快从伤病中完全恢复，但是奥卡福能否在76人的长人阵中有位置还是个问题。
上个赛季，奥卡福32%的得分来自低位进攻，这一比例高于考辛斯、武切维奇和布鲁克·洛佩斯，同时他的使用率也高居联盟前40。
随着西蒙斯已经展现了出色的控球前锋潜质，恩比德也拥有着更适合NBA比赛的身材，奥卡福的地位恐怕很难再那么稳固了。
过去两个赛季，汤普森的使用率已经稳定在了联盟前20，而这也是他生涯最出色的两个赛季。
不过问题是，随着杜兰特的到来，汤普森的使用率一定会下降，这势必将影响他的发挥。
这一影响将不仅是出手次数的影响，汤神的持球进攻在下赛季肯定也会大大减少，这在某些方面也会降低对手对他的防守难度。
杜兰特的到来一定会让勇士队的球员们数据缩水，但这其中缩水最严重的恐怕就是汤普森了。
但这并不意味着汤神的水平退步，这更像是他为球队整体做出了牺牲。
帕克在上个赛季表现得比数据反映的要好些，不仅是因为他的篮下效率来到了生涯最高，他和阿尔德里奇的化学反应也让马刺队受益。
邓肯退役，吉诺比利宣布再战一年，GDP的组合最终也走到了尽头，作为三个人里最年轻的一个，法国跑车的油箱里也没有多少油了。
在得到了第三枚总冠军戒指之后，只有贾巴尔、乔丹和拉塞尔比詹姆斯赢得了更多的常规赛MVP，而乔丹是唯一一个FMVP比詹姆斯多的人。
哦，对了，詹姆斯刚刚为克利夫兰带来了过去52年里第一座职业体育冠军奖杯。
来到了职业生涯第14个赛季的詹姆斯需要更好的保证体力，为季后赛做好准备。
因此，在常规赛里，詹姆斯的数据很可能进一步下滑，他会把更多的重担分给欧文来承担，不过他仍然会轻松地成为联盟前三的球员。",1017,"Many NBA players are able to prove their ability to play but there are people who fall off.
Whether it is due to age or limited playing time, there are always players who gets worse each season.
Of course those deemed to have ""gotten worse"" may just be due to the limited stats and data, and they may actually not have gotten worse.
Despite Dwayne Wade being one of the top shooting guards in the league, he will probably not perform as well with the Bulls than he did back with the Heat.
The backcourt range of Wade and Rondo is limited and Butler who is the star player only has a 32.8% 3-point percentage. This will make their offence limited in the next season.
In the windy city, the Flash (Wade) needs to give control of the ball more to Butler and Rondo, while he takes a more conservative approach and stay healthy.
Okafor's situation is more awkward. Despite being the number one draft for the 76ers last season, he has to compete with Simmons and Embiid for playing time and ball in the upcoming season.
Playing for the spot won't be right away as Simmons still needs to get used to the NBA games, and Embiid need to quickly recover from injuries. The issue remains if Okafor will be able to stay in the 76'ers roster in the long run.
Last season, Okafor' was scoring 32% from the low post, which is higher than Cousins, Vucevic, and Brook Lopez. He also has a usage rate of 40 in the league.
With Simmons already showing excellent potential as a forward, and Embiid having good potential for the NBA, it may be difficult for Okafor to find a stable role.
In the past two seasons, Thompson's usage rate has stabilized at the top 20 in the league, and his last two seasons has been the best in his career.
However, with Durant joining the team, the issues would be that Thompson's use rate will certainly decline, and is bound to affect his performance.
This will impact his shots taken and will surely reduce greatly next season and make the opponent defend him easier.
The arrival of Durant will limit the stats of the Warrior's players, and the player that would be the most affected would most likely be Thompson.
But this does not mean Thompson's playing ability will get worse. It is more a matter of fact that he will need to make some sacrifice for the team.
Parker performed better than the data reflected last season, not only because his efficiency was at the highest level of his career, but his chemistry with Aldridge also benefited the Spurs.
With Duncan retiring and Ginobili playing one last season, the era of Ginobili, Duncan and Parker will finally come to an end. As the youngest of the three, there is not much gas left in the tank for the French import.
After winning the third championship ring, only Jabbar, Jordan and Russell and James won more regular-season MVPs, and Jordan is the only person with more Finals MVP than James.
Oh and James has just brought home Cleveland's first professional sports championship cup in 52 years.
In LeBron's 14 season of his career, he will need to maintain his physical condition to prepare for the playoffs.
His stats will probably decline in the regular season as give the ball more to Osman. However, he will still easily be the top three players in the league."

8月8日上午10点左右，黄伊琳的父亲在酒店休息，母女俩出来准备逛逛阆中古城。
刚走了没多远，突然看到一群人在大呼小叫，出于好奇便走上前去。
眼看着“小男孩已不见了踪影，小女孩在水里拼命扑腾，江面上只露出她的小脑袋，不时往下沉”，小时候学过游泳的黄伊琳急急忙忙地跳下去救人。
下水后，身高165厘米的黄伊琳发现竟踩不到底!
之前看上去平静的水面，底下却是激流!
但她还是不顾一切地游向小女孩。
黄伊琳说，江水浑浊、湍急，不到5米的距离，几乎花光了她所有的力气。
她拼尽全力把小女孩推到河堤边，“斜坡特别滑，我怕自己没有力气也沉下去了。”
于是，黄伊琳向妈妈求救，听到女儿的呼救，水性不好的尹女士准备下水营救，被旁边的游客拦住。

Huang Yilin is a student from Central South University of Forestry and Technology for the class of 2015.
Huang Yilin, who was studying urban and rural planning, wanted to visit Sichuan Zhongzhong to learn about the local architectural design, thus travelled together with her family.
At around 10:00 on August 8, Huang Yilin’s father was resting at the hotel, while Huang Yilin and her mom went out to walk around Langzhong Ancient City.
Without venturing too far, they saw a group of people yelling and screaming thus went up to see what the commotion was about.
She saw that ""the boy was already out of sight and the girl was desperately trying to stay above water with only half her head visible as her head bobbled up and down in the river"". Huang Yilin had learned how to swim when she was young and jumped in quickly to save the child.
After diving in, Huang Yilin realized that despite being 165 cm tall, her feet could not touch the bottom of the river! 
Although the surface of the river seemed calm, the current was strong underneath! 
But she was still determined to swim toward the girl.
Huang Yilin said that the river was muddy and turbulent and she had to use almost all her strength to reach the girl who was less than 5 meters away.
She tried her best to push the little girl to the edge of the river bank. ""The slope was very slippery and I was afraid that I would use up my energy and sink.""
Huang Yilin called out to her mom for help. Her mom heard her cry for help and was about to go in the water and help. However as her mom was not in proper attire, she was stopped by a tourist beside her.
On August 10th, after Huang Yilin jumped in the river to save the child, her mom was bombarded with comments, compliments, and ""questions"" from friends and relatives.
""If you look back at it now, it was really scary! To be honest, when she could barely hold on to the riverbank and called to me for help, my heart almost shattered.""
Ms. Yin said that despite being dangerous, she would still support her daughter's decision if something like this happened again. She was very proud of her daughter! 
Because Huang Yilin was forced to learn swimming, she never really swam after learning how to swim but ""never thought it would come in handy in such a situation.""

The conditions of the water polo pool got worse during the match between Australia and Japan. Officials stressed that they will restore the water quality of the two pools to their original colors on the 11th.
Mario Andrada, a spokesman for the Rio Olympic Games, said ""The alkaline level of water in the diving pool weakened first yesterday afternoon.""
""We understand that one of the reasons that affect water quality and color is the alkalinity of water.""
The water sports center conducted a series of tests on water quality. Hundreds of divers and swimmers used the swimming pool to determine if the water quality condition meets the standards. ”
""We have followed normal procedures in the last few days but we may have overlooked that the usage of the pool by more athletes could affect the water quality.""
""But we can say that the discoloration is not a health concern and will especially not affect the athletes.""
""This independent team confirmed our assessment and affirmed our measures to restore the pool to normal colors and normal chemical conditions.""
""We had hoped to restore the pool to its original color in the morning but the work was slowed down due to the rain.""

With the investment boom slowing down, investments have entered a wait-and-see period.

However, just as most of the IOMT companies struggled in the A or B round of financing, there were several leading companies in the niche areas who were still able to obtain sufficient capital.

目前全国至少已有28个省份明确了津贴发放标准，不过各省市发放的标准并不一样，而重庆则是按高温工作日津贴的方式领取高温津贴。
35℃以上37℃以下的，按每人每天不低于10元标准发放；37℃以上的，按每人每天不低于15元标准发放。
40℃以上高温工作人员每月最多可领20元/天的津贴（劳动者已经依法享受高温作业岗位津贴的除外）。
按照这一标准，上个月高温天气天数最多的开州能领到330元，天数最少的城口则是80元，而酉阳最高温由于没达到高温标准外，所以没有高温津贴。
以往不少单位会以清凉饮品冲抵高温津贴，市安监局表示这种行径不合乎现行办法。
因高温天气停止工作、缩短工作时间的，用人单位不得扣除或降低劳动者工资。
市人社局表示，员工遇到高温下作业却没收到高温津贴的，可通过企业所在的劳动争议调解机构争取合法权益，或拨打12333投诉。
有用人单位拒不发放高温津贴的，劳动者可向用工所在地县级以上人力资源社会保障主管部门投诉。
同时由于高温津贴是工资的一部分，不是福利，要纳入工资总额、扣减个税。

Currently, there are at least 28 provinces in China that have clearly defined the standards for the subsidy. However, the standards issued by provinces and cities are not the same. Chongqing, on one other hand, receives heat allowances in the form of heat allowances on weekdays.
If the temperature is 35°C to 37°C , a rate of not less than 10 yuan per person per day; if it exceeds 37°C, the rate shall not be less than 15 yuan per person per day.
Workers working in high temperature environment above 40°C can receive up to 20 yuan per day per month (except for laborers who already receive the heat allowance according to law).
According to this standard, Kaizhou, had the most days of high-temperature weather last month, and was able to receive 330 yuan, and Chengkou had the least number of days which equated to 80 yuan. The highest temperature recorded in Puyang did not reach the high temperature standard, so there was no heat allowance.
In the past, many would give cold drinks instead of heat allowances. The City Work Safety Administration stated that such practices are not in line with current regulations.
The employer may not deduct or reduce the wages of workers due to the stoppage of work due to high temperature and reduce working hours.
The Municipal Bureau of Human Resources and Social Affairs stated that when an employee faces a situation where a the work environment is considered high-temperature but does not receive a heat allowance, he or she can seek legal rights through the labor dispute mediation agency where the company is located, or call 12333 to file a complaint.
Where a company refuses to issue a heat allowance, the laborer may complain to the appropriate department in human resources and social security at or above the county level where the employment is located.
Also, because heat allowances are part of wages and not benefits, they must be included in total wages and deducted from taxes.

OPEC还在月报中表示，原油价格低廉已促使全球炼油商生产更多精炼油品，从而加重了市场供应过剩的程度。
受此消息影响，再加上美国上调原油产量预期和原油库存意外增加，国际油价连续两日收跌。
截至周三收盘，纽约商品交易所9月交货的轻质原油期货价格下跌2.48%，10月交货的伦敦布伦特原油期货价格下跌2.07%。
路透社认为，提议召开的产油国会议不太可能令供应明显收紧，美国能源信息署公布的数据也打压市场人气。
伊朗官方通讯社Fars周三援引伊朗石油部长赞加内的发言称，伊朗的日原油产量最高为385万桶，这是2008年以来的最高水平。
召开会议的消息刚出，俄罗斯能源部长诺瓦克就表示，当前油价下没有进行新一轮冻产谈判的必要。
上次产油国召开会议已经是4月份的事情，OPEC成员国未能就任何措施达成协议。
BMIResearch石油与天然气分析师理查兹（Emma Richards）表示，市场和媒体可能对OPEC将召开的会议反应过度。
加拿大皇家银行大宗商品策略主管克罗夫特（Helima Croft）表示，OPEC通过释放他们将促成协议的信号来改变市场的情绪。
这个手段就像是引开人视线的烟雾与镜子（故意给人错误印象）。
德国商业银行大宗商品研究主管温伯格（Eugen Weinberg）称，人们认为OPEC试图通过9月会议稳定市场的可能性很低。
这很可能进一步破坏市场对OPEC的信心，毕竟这个组织上演过一次“狼来了”。",794,"Unfortunately, the latest OPEC monthly report shows that crude oil production continued to increase in July, and Saudi Arabia's production hit a new high.
This report doesn't prevent the market from doubting OPEC. The road to recovery for oil price seems to be a tough one.
On Monday, Sada who is OPEC's president and Qatar's Energy Minister said that OPEC will hold an informal meeting during the International Energy Forum on September 26-28.
The monthly report released by OPEC on Wednesday showed that all OPEC members including Gabon increased their July production by an additional 46,000 barrels per day to 33.11 million barrels per day.
OPEC also said in its monthly report that low crude oil prices have prompted the world's refiners to produce more refined oil products, which has increased the level of excess supply in the market.
The international oil price fell for two consecutive days with this news and as the US raised their forecast on crude oil production along with the unexpected increase in crude oil inventory.
As of Wednesday's close, the New York Mercantile Exchange's September delivery of light crude oil futures fell 2.48%, and the October delivery of London Brent crude oil futures fell 2.07%.
Reuters believes that the proposed meeting of oil-producing countries is unlikely to significantly tighten supply, and data released by the US Energy Information Administration also weighed on market sentiment.
Iran’s official news agency Fars quoted Iran’s oil minister Zaganga’s statement on Wednesday, saying that Iran’s maximum daily crude oil output was 3.85 million barrels, which is the highest level since 2008.
The result of the meeting was just announced and the Russian Energy Minister Novak stated that there is no need for a new round of negotiations on production freeze with the current oil price.
The meeting with the oil-producing country was back in April. OPEC member states were not able to reach an agreement whatsoever. 
Emma Richards, an oil and gas analyst at BMI Research, said that the market and the media may be a bit too sensitive to the OPEC meeting.
Helima Croft, head of commodities strategy at Royal Bank of Canada, said that OPEC changed market sentiment by releasing signals that they would facilitate the deal.
This is like the smoke and mirror method of drawing away attention (and giving the wrong impression).
Eugen Weinberg, Head of Commodity Research at Commerzbank AG, said that people think that OPEC is unlikely to try to stabilize the market through the September meeting.
This is likely to further undermine the market's confidence in OPEC, after all, the organization has already pulled ""the boy who cried wolf."""
78,"从表面上看，网络社交平台扩大了交际圈，降低了人们的孤独感。
网络社交的势力范围越发广泛，不仅逐渐取代传统的电话联络，甚至渗入到线下真实的生活圈，悄然改变当下民众的社交生活。
线上社交的好处是显而易见的，比如方便快捷，所以特别容易受到年轻族群的青睐。
一项针对大学生社交习惯的调查显示，57%的大学生每天使用手机的时间超过5小时，日常生活基本“机不离手”。
“社交网络具有低成本、传输速度快、多人同时交流等特点，符合当代大学生的需求。”
扩大人际关系圈，更平等地对话，避免社交顾虑，才是我们越发深爱线上聊的主要原因。
刚进公司的新人热爱跟同事线上交流，“因为才进单位大家不太熟，通过社交平台的点赞评论，关系才比以前近了许多”。
爱交友的也常用线上交流，“之前跟朋友因为一些误会有段时间没联络了，后来在一个大群里先对话几句才又热络起来。”
IT工程师吴言是深度网络社交爱好者，他大部分的社交生活都发生于线上，网络联系人更数倍于线下朋友圈人数。
吴言自己也坦言在网络上更“如鱼得水”。
“可以在自己方便愿意的时候回复朋友，因为有很多斟酌字句的时间，表述也能更清楚。”
“隐藏在ID之下的你来我往避免了面对面的人际碰撞，不仅有了回旋的余地，甚至给了彼此更多思忖言行的时间和空间。”
“不同身份的人有了同样发言的权利和效率，现实生活中的种种社交顾虑，在网络空间似乎都一下消除。”
然而吴言的朋友小鹏却觉得，生活中的吴言是个“蛮无趣的宅男”。
小鹏和吴言在一个大群里相识，因为两人都是积极发言者，很快就熟络起来了。
小鹏觉得吴言跟网络上判若两人，言语枯燥，也不主动发表意见，翻来覆去就是几句“呵呵，好的，是吗”，要不就是“这个我要上网查一下”。",716,"On the surface, the social networking platform has expanded the circle of communication and reduced people's loneliness.
The social circle of cyberspace has become more and more common. It has not only gradually replaced the traditional means of communication by phone, but is also affecting our social circles.
It is quietly changing the social lives of people. The benefits of social networking online are obvious, such as the convenience, and especially cater to the young generation.
A survey on college students’ social habits shows that 57% of college students spend more than five hours a day using mobile phones, and it has become inseparable with their daily lives.
""The social network has the characteristics of inexpensive, fast, and being able to network with a large crowd, which is in line with the needs of college students today.""
Expanding the circle of interpersonal relationships, a more equal dialogue, and avoiding social concerns are the main reasons why we love chatting online more.
New company staffs likes to communicate with their coworkers online. ""As many are not familiar with it, they communicated without borders which built a good relationship among them.""
People who like to make friends also like to use this. ""There was an instance where I had lost contact with someone due to a misunderstanding. However I was able to connect with that person again by conversing in groups.""
Wu Yan, an IT engineer, is an in-depth social networking enthusiast. Most of his social life happens online, where the number of people online is several times more than those offline.
Wu Yan admits that being online is ""like being a fish in the water"".
""You can reply your friends at your own pace. You will be able to express yourself better as you have time to think about what to write.""
""You can stay behind your online ID and avoid face-to-face conflict; will have the peace of mind to think things out before taking action.""
""Two different people can come together and communicate at the same level. Thus the social concerns in real life seem to be non-existent online.""
However, Wu’s friend Xiaopeng thinks that Wu’s life is enclosed and abnormal.
Xiaopeng and Wu Yan met in a large group and as they were both active talkers, they quickly became good friends.
Xiaopeng felt that Wu Yan and two other people online were bland and did not actively express their opinions. Their replies were often ""Oh, ok, really,"" or ""Let me check online.""

144,"国家发展改革委产业协调司负责人今天在此间指出，钢铁产能过剩是全球性问题。
我国近年产能利用率均高于全球平均水平，也高于美欧等国家和地区。
我国已经采取坚决有效的措施化解过剩产能，而且成效正在逐步显现。
该负责人指出，对钢铁产能过剩这一全球性问题，党中央国务院高度重视。
各部门、各地区积极贯彻落实国务院部署，认真开展工作，今年要压减粗钢产能4500万吨左右。
从我国国情出发，我国并不鼓励钢材出口，相反，还采取一系列切实措施控制钢材出口。
这位负责人强调，钢铁产品国际贸易本质上讲是市场行为，是源于进口国需求、消费者综合考虑产品性价比等因素后的自主选择。
实施贸易保护措施无助于从根本上解决全球钢铁产业的发展问题，相反，只会对国际贸易秩序造成进一步冲击。
在谈到债务时，该负责人强调，化解债务问题是化解过剩产能过程中需要妥善处理好的重要问题。
由于钢铁企业资产规模大，涉及面广，一些企业的债务关系复杂，如果处置不当，有可能引发区域性风险。
据该负责人介绍，近年来，随着经济下行压力加大，社会总需求逐步减弱，部分行业产能利用率下降，企业生产经营困难加大。
一些企业不适应市场环境变化，生产经营难以为继甚至濒临倒闭，但受一些体制机制因素制约，以市场化方式退出的障碍较多，成为“僵尸企业”。
这类企业的存在，扭曲了市场信号，降低了要素资源利用效率，增加了社会管理成本，妨碍了公平竞争市场环境的建立。
导致亏损的主要原因与全球钢铁行业面临的困境一样——市场需求不振、产能利用率低。
我国主要采取市场机制、经济手段和法治办法，政府主要是做好职工兜底和社会稳定工作，保证公平公正的市场秩序。
这位负责人强调，下一步，要坚定不移继续抓好去产能工作，确保完成5年化解粗钢产能1亿~1.5亿吨的目标任务。",743,"Today, the head of the Industry Coordination Department of the National Development and Reform Commission pointed out that the excess capacity of steel is a global issue.
In recent years, China's capacity utilization rate has been higher than the global average. It is also higher than the United States and Europe and in other countries.
China has taken quick and effective measures to resolve the issue of overproduction, and is gradually coming into effect.
The person in charge pointed out that the Central Committee and the State Council excess capacity of steel is a global issue.
All departments and regions actively implemented the State Council's orders and actively carried them out. The crude steel production capacity this year should be reduced by around 45 million tons.
From a national standpoint, China does not encourage the export of steel products. Instead, it adopts a series of practical measures to control the export of steel products.
The person in charge emphasized that international trade of steel products is a market-driven decision made by the needs of the importing country based on the price and other factors.
The implementation of trade protection measures will not fundamentally solve the problem of global steel industry development. On the contrary, it will only cause further issues to the international market.
The person in charge also emphasized that resolving the deficit issue is important and needs to be resolved properly and concurrently with the issue of excess capacity.
As the asset and scope of steel making companies are massive, the debt issue of some companies are complex and there will be a regional risk if it is not handled appropriately.
According to the person in charge, in recent years, as the pressure of economic downturn has increased, the total social demand has gradually weakened, and the capacity utilization rate of some industries has declined. As a result, the production and operation of enterprises have become increasingly difficult.
Some enterprises are unable adapt to the changes in the market, thus production and management are difficult to sustain and lead to bankruptcy. However, due to the constraints of some institutional mechanisms, there are many obstacles to market-based withdrawal which leads to companies becoming ""zombie companies"".
The existence of such enterprises has distorted market signals, reduced resource utilization efficiency, increased social management costs, and hindered the establishment of a fair market environment.
The main cause of losses is the same as the predicament faced by the global steel industry. Basically the market demand is weak and capacity utilization is low.
Our country mainly adopts market mechanisms, economic instruments, and regulations. The government mainly does a good job for all employees and provide social stability to ensure a fair market.
The person in charge emphasized that in the next step, we must diligently continue to do a good job in the production capacity and ensure that the target of reducing 100 to 150 million tons of crude steel production capacity is completed in five years.

敲锣打鼓的音乐、传统的小食、花俏的装饰、人群汹涌的现场。
由香港潮属社团总会主办的“2016盂兰文化节”12日至14日在维多利亚公园举办，这是香港最盛大的一场盂兰胜会。
除了延续已有的“抢孤竞赛”，还增加了全家可以参加的“亲子盆供堆垒赛”。
不仅用漫画形式介绍盂兰文化历史，现场还设有盂兰主题3D自拍区、传统小食区以及传统手艺流动教室等，吸引不少小朋友和海外人士来体验参观。
一对来自法国的夫妻在活动现场逗留了近3个小时，并且在迷你花牌流动教室体验了一番。
“在网上查到这个特别的节日，所以决定来看看，感到很新鲜。”
他们表示，虽然法国也有类似纪念先人的节日，但气氛很沉重，不像这里，有音乐，有食物还可以学习传统手艺。
她说，“在香港这么繁忙的金融大都市，还能看到这么有规模、有组织的祭拜祖先的仪式。”
“这不仅体现了中国文化的多元性，还能让更多人了解这些传统手艺并且传承下去。”
本次活动总统筹胡炎松表示，“我们不想把盂兰文化节布置得很恐怖，让人不敢接近，特别是小孩子。”
“我们希望通过现场年轻化的活动和布置，让年轻人知道盂兰节文化背后想表达的是孝道和感恩。“
他也表示，这次共有24个队伍参加“抢孤竞赛”，其中不仅有社团组织，还与一些学校合作，让学生参加。

There will be drum music, traditional snacks, fancy decorations, and crowds of people.
The ""2016 Yulan Cultural Festival"" organized by the Federation of Hong Kong Chiu Chow Community Organizations was held in Victoria Park from the 12th to the 14th. This is the most spectacular event in Hong Kong.
Aside from the traditional ""ghost grappling competition"", they also added a new ""Yu Lan festival offerings competition for families"" that everyone can participate in.
In addition to explaining the history of Yulan through comics, there is also a thematic 3D photo shooting featuring Yulan on site. There is also an area serving traditional snacks and where you can experience traditional handcraft workshops that attracts many kids and people from abroad to take a look and experience it for themselves.
There was a couple from France that stayed at the event for almost 3 hours and enjoyed the full experience of the mini flower card workshop.
""I learned about this special holiday on the internet, so I decided to come take a look and was a really refreshing experience.""
They said that although France has similar festivals to commemorate ancestors, the atmosphere is very somber. Unlike the ones back home, there is music, food, and traditional craft here to enjoy.
She said, “we were able to see an organized and large scaled festival to worship ancestors along with busy financial metropolis of Hong Kong.""
“This not only reflects the diversity of Chinese culture, but also allows more people to understand these traditional crafts and pass them on to future generations.”
Hu Yansong, president of the event, said: “We don’t want to make the Yulan Festival so somber and scary that people won't want to come. Especially the children.”
""We hope that through this event, we can convey to the younger generation that the meaning behind the Yulan festival is about filial piety and appreciation.""
He also stated that there were 24 teams in the ""ghost grappling competition"" of which we had a team from the community organization, and some schools so that students can participate as well.
It is recognized that the Yulan festival was listed as part of ""China Intangible Cultural Heritage"" 2011."
