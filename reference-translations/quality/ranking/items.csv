As the canal developer, HKND Group continued to observe international best practice, and constructed the canal according to international standards, protecting Nicaragua's ecological environment as much as possible."" University students, by combining theory and practice, led secondary and primary school students to plant trees, teaching the next generation of Nicaraguans about afforestation and how to go green. National Agrarian University (Nicaragua) Faculty of Natural Resources and Environment Professor Francisco Reyes led a team to participate in an afforestation education project. We have reasons to believe that the transoceanic canal project led by the HKND Group will benefit the people of Nicaragua immensely and provide more employment opportunities in the region."" To ensure long-term benefits of tree planting and reforestation programs, HKND Group also released an illustrated book with tree planting and reforestation training that was given to 15,000 junior-high and elementary school students of Rivas.

1d,4,cd,11,54,725:747,尽管还没有被证实，但诸多消息源都表示，苹果2016年秋季发布会将在9月举行，iPhone7真要来了。 虽然苹果公司并未回应，但有关新iPhone的功能、配置已经陆续有消息放出，甚至网上连iPhone7“真机模型”图片都有了。 新一代iPhone可谓“万众瞩目”，火热、紧俏、有钱无货……如果你想第一时间购买到正品，一定要选择一个好渠道，比如说，苏宁。 这加剧了人们对于新手机的失望，“它加长了，却根本不能投射全息图像!这一代iPhone糟透了。” iPhone7像其他iPhone一样，出生之前就伴随着无数秘闻。 另外，还有多个消息源声称，新一代iPhone将取消3.5mm耳机接口，转而使用蓝牙连接和充电接口，这将为苹果增加第二个扬声器提供空间。 能佐证这一消息的另一证据是，早在2014年苹果就允许耳机厂商生产通过充电接口连接的耳机产品。 这些消息或真或假，答案直到苹果2016秋季发布会才能揭晓。 但这并不妨碍业内人士看好iPhone7的前景——许多人认为，iPhone7将很有可能成为苹果对iPhone系列的最后一次大幅升级。 虽然从不久前市场研究机构IDC公布的数据来看，iPhone的市场份额有所下滑。 其中，高盛将苹果的股票维持“买入”评级，而BMO的分析师则认为iPhone7将收获一份历史性的销售成绩。 同时博通公司的CEO Hock Tan也表示，苹果未来的营收增加将有可能超过20%，而这完全得益于iPhone7的推出。 有7%的受访者表示他们有购买iPhone7的打算，而两年前计划购买iPhone6的人数比例只有4%。 据了解，目前持有iPhone6或6Plus的用户群体有20%计划购买iPhone7，这是一个相当高的比例。 其次，有专家分析，大部分果粉都喜欢隔代更换自己的iPhone手机。 据统计，在所有的iPhone用户中，有大约26%的用户已经2年没有更换手机了，也就是差不多有1.2亿的用户的iPhone已经用了2年。 有媒体称，iPhone7生产期间，台湾遭遇数次地震，“台积电生产设施的受破坏程度超出想象，并有可能对初期的iPhone7供应产生影响。” 供需矛盾会影响普通用户，是时候选择一个好渠道，第一时间低价入手正品iPhone7。 据知情人士透露，近期，苏宁高层与苹果公司频频见面，目的就是为了准备充足的货源。 运营商已经与苏宁谈妥，可以预见的是，随着双方的深度合作，必然会为用户带来更低的价格和更贴心的服务。 “最低的价格，消费者可能‘一天只需7元钱，就能购买iPhone7’。” 充足的货源与多样的优惠，让购买iPhone7不再“压力山大”，而苏宁的物流，更是会把这种美好变成更直观的体验感。 也许，你半夜就会接到电话，“您好，苏宁易购，您的iPhone7到了。”,"Although it hasn't been confirmed, numerous sources have said Apple's fall 2016 launch will take place in September, and the iPhone 7 is really coming. Apple didn't respond, but word has spread about the new iPhone's features and configuration, and even pictures of the iPhone 7's ""real model"" are available online. The next generation of iPhones is ""eye-catching"", hot, hot, rich and out of stock... If you want to buy the real thing for the first time, make sure you choose a good channel, say, Suning. This added to the frustration over the new phone, ""It lengthens, but it doesn't project a hologram at all! This generation of iPhones sucks."" The iPhone 7, like other iPhones, has been accompanied by countless secrets before it was born. Also, multiple sources have claimed that the new iPhone will eliminate the 3.5mm headphone jack and instead use a Bluetooth connection and charging jack, which would give Apple room to add a second speaker. Another piece of evidence to back up the news is that back in 2014 Apple allowed headphone makers to make headphone products that were connected through a charging interface. The news is either true or false, and the answer won't be revealed until Apple's autumn 2016 launch. But that doesn't detract from the industry's bullish outlook for the iPhone 7 - which many believe will most likely be Apple's last major upgrade to the iPhone family. Though the iPhone's market share has fallen, according to data released recently by market research firm IDC. Among them, Goldman Sachs maintained a ""buy"" rating on Apple's stock, while BMO analysts said the iPhone 7 would reap a historic sales performance. At the same time, Hock Tan, CEO of Broadcom, said it was likely that Apple would increase revenue by more than 20 percent in the future, thanks entirely to the launch of the iPhone 7. Seven percent of respondents said they planned to buy the iPhone 7, compared with just four percent two years ago. It is understood that 20 per cent of the current group of users who hold the iPhone 6 or 6Plus plan to buy the iPhone 7, which is a fairly high percentage. Second, there is expert analysis, most of the fruit powder like to replace their iPhone handsets from generation to generation. About 26 percent of all iPhone users have not changed their phone in two years, or nearly 120 million users have had their iPhone for two years, according to the report. Media captionTaiwan has been hit by several earthquakes during the production of the iPhone 7. ""TSMC's production facilities have been damaged beyond imagination and could have an impact on the initial supply of the iPhone 7."" Contradictions between supply and demand will affect ordinary users, it is time to choose a good channel, the first time low prices to start the genuine iPhone 7. According to people familiar with the matter, recently, Suning executives have been meeting with Apple frequently in order to prepare an adequate supply. The operator has already negotiated with Suning, and predictably, with the deep cooperation between the two sides, it is bound to bring lower prices and more intimate services to users. ""At the lowest price, consumers might be able to buy an iPhone 7 for as little as $7 a day,"" he said. Sufficient supply and a variety of concessions, so that the purchase of the iPhone 7 is no longer ""pressure mountain,"" and Suning's logistics, is to turn this beautiful into a more intuitive experience. Maybe you'll get a call in the middle of the night saying, ""Hello, Suning EasyJet, your iPhone 7 is here.""","It has not yet been confirmed yet, but many sources have indicated that Apple's 2016 fall conference will be held in September. The iPhone 7 is really going to come out. Although Apple did not comment, information and specification of the new iPhone has been released and there are ""actual"" photos of the iPhone 7 on the web. The new generation of the iPhone is going to be slick, popular, and limited, thus if you want to be one of the first one to get a hold of it, be sure to know where to buy it from...like Suning. ""This has led to further disappointment in the new phone. It is longer but can't even take videos. This generation of iPhone is terrible."" Like the other iPhones, iPhone 7 had its share of secrets before being released. In addition, there are multiple sources claiming that the new generation of iPhone will not feature a 3.5mm headphone jack and use Bluetooth connectivity instead and will just have the charging port. This will provide space for Apple to add a second speaker. As evidence to backup this claim, Apple had developed earphones that would connect to the charging port back in 2014. Regardless of whether the rumors are true or not, we will only know for sure when it is announced in Apple's fall 2016 conference. However, this does not prevent the industry from looking at the potential specification of the iPhone 7 - many believe that the iPhone 7 will most likely be Apple's last major upgrade to the iPhone series. IDC, which is a market research institute recently released data that the market share of iPhone has declined. However, Goldman Sachs will maintain the ""buy"" rating for Apple's stock, and BMO analysts believe that iPhone7 will come together with a historic sales performance. Additionally, Broadcom’s CEO Hock Tan also stated that Apple’s future revenue growth may exceed 20%, all thanks to the launch of the iPhone 7. Seven percent of respondents said they had plans to purchase the iPhone 7, compared to only four percent who planned to purchase the iPhone 6 two years ago. It is understood that 20% of those currently using the iPhone 6 or 6 Plus plan to purchase the iPhone 7, which is a very high percentage. Also, experts analyzed that most of Apple consumers like to replace their iPhones every generation. According to the data, about 26% of all iPhone users have not changed their phones for 2 years. Which means almost 120 million people have used the iPhone for 2 years. Some media claimed that Taiwan faced several earthquakes during the production of iPhone 7 and, “The damage of TSMC's production facilities was bigger than expected and may affect the initial iPhone 7 supply.” The disparity between supply and demand will affect the average customers. It is time to choose a good place to buy an authentic iPhone 7 early at a lower price. According to informed sources, Suning executives met frequently with Apple in order to prepare enough stock. The company is already in discussion with Suning, and will inevitable provide a lower price and better service for consumers through a high-level of cooperation between the two parties. “At the lowest price, consumers may only need to pay 7 yuan a day to purchase the iPhone 7.” Plentiful stock and various services will make purchasing the iPhone less stressful. Through Suning's logistics, will further lead to a heightened buying experience. You may perhaps get a call in the middle of a night which will say ""Hi this is Suning.com. Your iPhone 7 is here.""",mt,human_b

1d,8,dd,22,144,1756:1771,国家发展改革委产业协调司负责人今天在此间指出，钢铁产能过剩是全球性问题。 我国近年产能利用率均高于全球平均水平，也高于美欧等国家和地区。 我国已经采取坚决有效的措施化解过剩产能，而且成效正在逐步显现。 该负责人指出，对钢铁产能过剩这一全球性问题，党中央国务院高度重视。 各部门、各地区积极贯彻落实国务院部署，认真开展工作，今年要压减粗钢产能4500万吨左右。 从我国国情出发，我国并不鼓励钢材出口，相反，还采取一系列切实措施控制钢材出口。 这位负责人强调，钢铁产品国际贸易本质上讲是市场行为，是源于进口国需求、消费者综合考虑产品性价比等因素后的自主选择。 实施贸易保护措施无助于从根本上解决全球钢铁产业的发展问题，相反，只会对国际贸易秩序造成进一步冲击。 在谈到债务时，该负责人强调，化解债务问题是化解过剩产能过程中需要妥善处理好的重要问题。 由于钢铁企业资产规模大，涉及面广，一些企业的债务关系复杂，如果处置不当，有可能引发区域性风险。 据该负责人介绍，近年来，随着经济下行压力加大，社会总需求逐步减弱，部分行业产能利用率下降，企业生产经营困难加大。 一些企业不适应市场环境变化，生产经营难以为继甚至濒临倒闭，但受一些体制机制因素制约，以市场化方式退出的障碍较多，成为“僵尸企业”。 这类企业的存在，扭曲了市场信号，降低了要素资源利用效率，增加了社会管理成本，妨碍了公平竞争市场环境的建立。 导致亏损的主要原因与全球钢铁行业面临的困境一样——市场需求不振、产能利用率低。 我国主要采取市场机制、经济手段和法治办法，政府主要是做好职工兜底和社会稳定工作，保证公平公正的市场秩序。 这位负责人强调，下一步，要坚定不移继续抓好去产能工作，确保完成5年化解粗钢产能1亿~1.5亿吨的目标任务。,"The head of the Department of Industry Coordination of the National Development and Reform Commission pointed out today that overcapacity in the steel industry was a global issue. Production capacity utilization in our country is higher than that of the global average, and higher than those in the US and Europe. Our country has taken definite and effective measures to address excess production capacity, and preliminary results are gradually emerging. The person-in-charge pointed out that the State Council of the People's Republic of China has placed great importance upon the global issue of excessive steel and iron production capacity. All departments and regions shall actively implement the plans of State Council, and work conscientiously to reduce crude steel production capacity by about 45 million tonnes this year. From the perspective of domestic national conditions, China does not encourage steel exports. On the contrary, it has adopted a series of practical measures to control steel exports. The person in charge emphasized that the international trade of steel products is essentially market behavior. It is triggered by demand from importing nations, as well as the voluntary choice of consumers after taking into consideration a number of factors such as the products' price-performance ratio. The implementation of protectionist measures will not help to fundamentally resolve the development issues of the global steel industry. Instead, this would only result in a further attack on international trade order. When talking about the debt, the person-in-charge emphasized that the key for resolving the debt issue is to properly take care of excessive production capacity. As steel enterprises have massive assets, and cover a broad spectrum, the debt relationships of some of these enterprises are complicated. If handled inappropriately, regional risk could result. The person in charge described that recent increase in economic pressures have led to weakening of overall demands from the society. Production capacity utilization for a number of industries have decreased, increasing the difficulties for corporate production and operations. Some enterprises were unable to adapt to changes in the market environment. Business operations became unsustainable, and were even on the brink of collapse. Constrained by institutional mechanisms however, there were more hindrances to market-oriented exits, resulting in ""zombie enterprises"". The existence of such enterprises distorted market signals, lowered the utilization rate of factor resources, increased the cost of public administration, and hindered the building of a fair and competitive market environment. The major reason for the losses is similar to the difficulty confronting the global steel industry - market demand is sluggish and capacity utilization rates are low. Our nation mainly adopts a market mechanism, economic means and the rule of law. The government is primarily focused on carrying out various aspects of worker resettlement and social stability, ensuring fair and just market order. The person in charge emphasized that the next step forward would be to steadfastly continue to eliminate excess production capacity, and to ensure that the goal of removing 100 million to 150 million tonnes of crude steel capacity in five years would be achieved.","Today, the head of the Industry Coordination Department of the National Development and Reform Commission pointed out that the excess capacity of steel is a global issue. In recent years, China's capacity utilization rate has been higher than the global average. It is also higher than the United States and Europe and in other countries. China has taken quick and effective measures to resolve the issue of overproduction, and is gradually coming into effect. The person in charge pointed out that the Central Committee and the State Council excess capacity of steel is a global issue. All departments and regions actively implemented the State Council's orders and actively carried them out. The crude steel production capacity this year should be reduced by around 45 million tons. From a national standpoint, China does not encourage the export of steel products. Instead, it adopts a series of practical measures to control the export of steel products. The person in charge emphasized that international trade of steel products is a market-driven decision made by the needs of the importing country based on the price and other factors. The implementation of trade protection measures will not fundamentally solve the problem of global steel industry development. On the contrary, it will only cause further issues to the international market. The person in charge also emphasized that resolving the deficit issue is important and needs to be resolved properly and concurrently with the issue of excess capacity. As the asset and scope of steel making companies are massive, the debt issue of some companies are complex and there will be a regional risk if it is not handled appropriately. According to the person in charge, in recent years, as the pressure of economic downturn has increased, the total social demand has gradually weakened, and the capacity utilization rate of some industries has declined. As a result, the production and operation of enterprises have become increasingly difficult. Some enterprises are unable adapt to the changes in the market, thus production and management are difficult to sustain and lead to bankruptcy. However, due to the constraints of some institutional mechanisms, there are many obstacles to market-based withdrawal which leads to companies becoming ""zombie companies"". The existence of such enterprises has distorted market signals, reduced resource utilization efficiency, increased social management costs, and hindered the establishment of a fair market environment. The main cause of losses is the same as the predicament faced by the global steel industry. Basically the market demand is weak and capacity utilization is low. Our country mainly adopts market mechanisms, economic instruments, and regulations. The government mainly does a good job for all employees and provide social stability to ensure a fair market. The person in charge emphasized that in the next step, we must diligently continue to do a good job in the production capacity and ensure that the target of reducing 100 to 150 million tons of crude steel production capacity is completed in five years.",human_a,human_b

1d,19,dd,4,118,1491:1506,可惜，OPEC最新月报显示出7月原油产量继续增加，沙特产量更创下新高。 这份报告不禁令市场对OPEC的信誉产生怀疑，油价复苏的道路恐怕仍然布满荆棘。 本周一，OPEC轮值主席兼卡塔尔能源大臣萨达表示，OPEC将在9月26-28日的国际能源论坛期间举行非正式会议。 OPEC周三公布的月报显示，包括加蓬在内的整个OPEC组织7月产量上升4.6万桶/日，至3311万桶/日。 OPEC还在月报中表示，原油价格低廉已促使全球炼油商生产更多精炼油品，从而加重了市场供应过剩的程度。 受此消息影响，再加上美国上调原油产量预期和原油库存意外增加，国际油价连续两日收跌。 截至周三收盘，纽约商品交易所9月交货的轻质原油期货价格下跌2.48%，10月交货的伦敦布伦特原油期货价格下跌2.07%。 路透社认为，提议召开的产油国会议不太可能令供应明显收紧，美国能源信息署公布的数据也打压市场人气。 伊朗官方通讯社Fars周三援引伊朗石油部长赞加内的发言称，伊朗的日原油产量最高为385万桶，这是2008年以来的最高水平。 召开会议的消息刚出，俄罗斯能源部长诺瓦克就表示，当前油价下没有进行新一轮冻产谈判的必要。 上次产油国召开会议已经是4月份的事情，OPEC成员国未能就任何措施达成协议。 BMIResearch石油与天然气分析师理查兹（Emma Richards）表示，市场和媒体可能对OPEC将召开的会议反应过度。 加拿大皇家银行大宗商品策略主管克罗夫特（Helima Croft）表示，OPEC通过释放他们将促成协议的信号来改变市场的情绪。 这个手段就像是引开人视线的烟雾与镜子（故意给人错误印象）。 德国商业银行大宗商品研究主管温伯格（Eugen Weinberg）称，人们认为OPEC试图通过9月会议稳定市场的可能性很低。 这很可能进一步破坏市场对OPEC的信心，毕竟这个组织上演过一次“狼来了”。,"Unfortunately, the latest monthly report of OPEC indicated continuous increase in crude oil production volume in July. Saudi Arabia even reached in a record height in terms of production volume. This report couldn't help but trigger market suspicion over OPEC's credibility. The path toward recovery in oil prices is still difficult. On Monday, Qatar's Energy Minister Mohammed Bin Saleh Al-Sada who holds OPEC's rotating presidency said that OPEC will hold an unofficial meeting during the International Energy Foundation conference which will be held between September 26 and 28. OPEC's monthly report published on Wednesday showed that OPEC's total output (including Gabon) in July rose by 46,000 barrels/day to 33.11 million barrels/day. OPEC expressed in its monthly report that the low price of crude oil has encouraged more refineries around the world to produce more refined oil products, worsening the issue of excessive supply in the market. This news, coupled with the US raising its crude oil production forecast and unexpected increase in crude oil stockpiles has caused global oil prices to fall for two consecutive days. The price of light crude oil futures for delivery in September closed 2.48% lower on the New York Mercantile Exchange as of Wednesday, while the price of Brent crude oil futures for delivery in October fell 2.07%. Reuters believe that the proposed conference of the petroleum producing countries is unlikely to order significant reduction in production. Data published by the US Energy Information Administration also cooled the market. Fars, the official media company of Iran, quoted Iranian Minister of Petroleum Zanganeh who said that the maximum crude oil production of Iran will be 3.85 million barrels per day, the highest volume since 2008. Once information for the meeting has been released, Novak, the Russian Minister of Energy, expressed that under current oil prices, there is no need to initiate a new round of negotiations regarding frozen assets. The last time oil producing naitons convened a meeting was in April. OPEC members failed to reach an agreement on any measure. BMI Research Oil and Gas Analyst Emma Richards said that the market and the media may have over-reacted to the meeting OPEC is about to convene. Helima Croft, Top Commodities Strategist of Royal Bank of Canada, expressed that OPEC has released signals that they would be reaching an agreement to transform the mood of the market. This method was like smoke and mirrors to divert people's attention (deliberately giving people the wrong impression). Eugen Weinberg, Head of Commodity Research at Commerzbank AG, said that people believe that there is a low possibility for OPEC to use the September meeting to stabilize the market. This might further disrupt market confidence for OPEC as this organization has ""cried wolf"" before.","Unfortunately, the latest OPEC monthly report shows that crude oil production continued to increase in July, and Saudi Arabia's production hit a new high. This report doesn't prevent the market from doubting OPEC. The road to recovery for oil price seems to be a tough one. On Monday, Sada who is OPEC's president and Qatar's Energy Minister said that OPEC will hold an informal meeting during the International Energy Forum on September 26-28. The monthly report released by OPEC on Wednesday showed that all OPEC members including Gabon increased their July production by an additional 46,000 barrels per day to 33.11 million barrels per day. OPEC also said in its monthly report that low crude oil prices have prompted the world's refiners to produce more refined oil products, which has increased the level of excess supply in the market. The international oil price fell for two consecutive days with this news and as the US raised their forecast on crude oil production along with the unexpected increase in crude oil inventory. As of Wednesday's close, the New York Mercantile Exchange's September delivery of light crude oil futures fell 2.48%, and the October delivery of London Brent crude oil futures fell 2.07%. Reuters believes that the proposed meeting of oil-producing countries is unlikely to significantly tighten supply, and data released by the US Energy Information Administration also weighed on market sentiment. Iran’s official news agency Fars quoted Iran’s oil minister Zaganga’s statement on Wednesday, saying that Iran’s maximum daily crude oil output was 3.85 million barrels, which is the highest level since 2008. The result of the meeting was just announced and the Russian Energy Minister Novak stated that there is no need for a new round of negotiations on production freeze with the current oil price. The meeting with the oil-producing country was back in April. OPEC member states were not able to reach an agreement whatsoever.  Emma Richards, an oil and gas analyst at BMI Research, said that the market and the media may be a bit too sensitive to the OPEC meeting. Helima Croft, head of commodities strategy at Royal Bank of Canada, said that OPEC changed market sentiment by releasing signals that they would facilitate the deal. This is like the smoke and mirror method of drawing away attention (and giving the wrong impression). Eugen Weinberg, Head of Commodity Research at Commerzbank AG, said that people think that OPEC is unlikely to try to stabilize the market through the September meeting. This is likely to further undermine the market's confidence in OPEC, after all, the organization has already pulled ""the boy who cried wolf.""",human_a,human_b

This responsibility is not only the physical well-being, but also mental development which is education. If you succeed in your business but disregard your child's education, it will not be enough to makeup for the failure of your life and family.

Responsibility of a child not only covers the physical well-being but also to educate them and help them develop mentally. Basically, let the child learn how to behave, grow up, and succeed. A good family environment is one where parents will always be with the child, and take care of the child whole-heartedly. Parents also needs to teach their child how to learn and become civilized. A parent's words and actions can affect how the child grows up. As a child would imitate parent's actions, there is a Chinese saying that a dragon will come from a dragon, a phoenix will come from a phoenix, and the child of a mouse will make holes, which basically means the whatever the parents do, the child will do the same. Therefore, parents have to a good role-model for their child.

In the Central American country of Costa Rica, the toucan Gracia and its story are extremely well-known. The August 10 press conference finally revealed Gracia after recovering from the operation, displaying its brand new 3D-printed plastic beak. This toucan whose upper beak was broken by someone, and which was on the brink of death, has now finally received a new lease of life. This is the day that the bird has reached 100% recovery and the day when it could be moved to a luxurious bird house and meet its human friends who have been caring for it. Gracia appears to be rather shy after moving to her new home, but quickly revealed her lively side, playing in the pool of water and using her new beak to eat grapes. To remind people of the abuse it once suffered, the technicians did not color its new beak, but kept it white, the original color of the 3D printing material. The external layer of the beak is a thin keratin sheath. The beak is hollow and only reinforced by thin, criss-crossing supporting struts of bone. Although reinforced internally, the toucan's beak is still fragile, and will crack when it is harmed. The animal aid center, an ornithologist, and a 3D printing company from the United States are working together, making several ""experimental beaks"" for Gracia before creating the ""perfect beak"" that best suits the bird. Now Gracia has become proficient in using her beak to drink, eat, and even pick up fine seed grains. ""The design of the final product took about two months; printing took just four to five hours."" ""3D printing is not for next generation. It has become part of our life."" Thomas Lange, President of SG3D told the  Xinhua News Agency. On January 2015, Gracia the toucan was found, bleeding from its mouth, by a person in a farm at Gracia, Alajuela Province in central Costa Rica. At the time, its upper beak was cruelly broken by a group of youths. It could not eat and was dying. Once reported in mass media, Gracia's sad state initiated a wave of outcry against animal abuse in and outside Costa Rica. The public requested more rigorous animal protection laws to be established, and punishment for abusers to be stepped out. People came forward voluntarily, and did the best they could to help Grecia regain its life prior to the injury. Even Chuck Hull, the inventor of 3D printing technology, also contributed towards the design of Gracia's upper beak. ""Gracia's condition is quite unique. Less than 1 cm of its upper beak has remained, making it difficult to install a new beak."" ""We first scanned Gracia and then designed and manufactured an extended prosthetic that is slightly longer than its remaining upper beak. The prosthetic is then glued to its upper beak."" ""This will help reduce further invasive injury on Grecia,"" Lange told a XInhua international news reporter. Prior to installing the prosthetics, workers cleaned the broken beak for Gracia everyday to prevent infections. Thousands of miles away, the story of Gracia the toucan has moved renowned documentary filmmaker Paula Heredia and investigative journalist John Hoffman. Toucan Nation is a documentary that recorded in detail the process of fitting a new beak for Grecia, which was broadcast on Animal Planet this month. The documentary Toucan Nation showed how a small toucan bird could change a country and encourage every citizen to participate in the movement against animal abuse.","Grecia is an adorable female toucan that exudes a tropical feel. The story of Grecia the toucan has been known early on in the Central American country of Costa Rica. In the press release on August 30th, Grecia who recovered from the surgery showed off her new prosthetic 3D printed beak to the public. The toucan whose beak was hacked off by humans and was dying a year and half ago is now reborn. This day not only confirms that she is 100% healthy, but also is a day when she will be relocated to a luxurious cage and a day for those who care about her to be able to see her. Grecia was a bit shy after moving to her new home but became more lively as she played in the water and ate grapes with her new beak. The engineering specialist did not newly paint the 3D printed beak to serve as a reminder to people of what she went through, thus leaving it in the original white color of the 3D printing material. The outer layer of the beak features a thin wall of keratin, and the inside is generally hollow and is only supported by several thin bone struts. Despite the interior being reinforced, the toucan's beak is still frail and can break when damaged. With the collaboration with the animal rescue center, bird specialists, and a US 3D printing company, the group was able to create several ""trial versions"" to identify and finally create ""the perfect one"". Grecia can now skillfully use her new beak to drink water, eat, and even pick up small grains. ""The design of the final product took around 2 months and the printing only took 4-5 hours."" The president of SG3D Printing, Thomas Lange explained to Xinhua International during an interview that, ""3D printing is not a technology of the future but has already stepped in to our lives"". In January 2015, a bloodied toucan (Grecia) was found on a farm in Grecia, Alajuela Province located in central Costa Rica. The beak was brutally hacked off by a group of youngsters. She could not eat at all and was in critical condition. After the media covered the story of Grecia's tragic situation, it triggered a wave of opposition on animal cruelty in and outside of Costa Rica. People have since called out for a stricter animal protection law and for harsher penalties for animal abuse. People proactively came together to do their best to help Grecia recover and regain her life before being injured. Chuck Hall who is the inventor of 3D printing was also involved in the design of Grecia's beak. ""Grecia's situation was a very special one as there was less than 1 cm of the upper jaw left, which caused many difficulties in attaching the beak."" ""We first scanned Grecia then designed an extended cap that was a bit longer than the remnant beak, then glued the prosthetic beak"". Lange told the reporters of Xinhua International that ""By doing so, we can prevent further injury for Grecia"". Before installing the prosthetic beak, the staff had to keep Grecia clean everyday to prevent infections. The story of Grecia the toucan travelled the distance and touched John Hoffman who is a producer at Discovery News Channel and Paul Heredia who is a famous documentary director. They filmed bits and pieces of the installation of Grecia's new beak to make a documentary called ""Toucan Nation"" which was aired on Animal Planet this month. The documentary ""Toucan Nation"" shows how a small Toucan inspired a nation to make changes and citizens to get involved to stop animal cruelty.",human_a,human_b

Huang Yilin is a student from Central South University of Forestry and Technology for the class of 2015. Huang Yilin, who was studying urban and rural planning, wanted to visit Sichuan Zhongzhong to learn about the local architectural design, thus travelled together with her family. At around 10:00 on August 8, Huang Yilin’s father was resting at the hotel, while Huang Yilin and her mom went out to walk around Langzhong Ancient City. Without venturing too far, they saw a group of people yelling and screaming thus went up to see what the commotion was about. She saw that ""the boy was already out of sight and the girl was desperately trying to stay above water with only half her head visible as her head bobbled up and down in the river"". Huang Yilin had learned how to swim when she was young and jumped in quickly to save the child. After diving in, Huang Yilin realized that despite being 165 cm tall, her feet could not touch the bottom of the river!  Although the surface of the river seemed calm, the current was strong underneath!  But she was still determined to swim toward the girl. Huang Yilin said that the river was muddy and turbulent and she had to use almost all her strength to reach the girl who was less than 5 meters away. She tried her best to push the little girl to the edge of the river bank. ""The slope was very slippery and I was afraid that I would use up my energy and sink."" Huang Yilin called out to her mom for help. Her mom heard her cry for help and was about to go in the water and help. However as her mom was not in proper attire, she was stopped by a tourist beside her. On August 10th, after Huang Yilin jumped in the river to save the child, her mom was bombarded with comments, compliments, and ""questions"" from friends and relatives. ""If you look back at it now, it was really scary! To be honest, when she could barely hold on to the riverbank and called to me for help, my heart almost shattered."" Ms. Yin said that despite being dangerous, she would still support her daughter's decision if something like this happened again. She was very proud of her daughter!  Because Huang Yilin was forced to learn swimming, she never really swam after learning how to swim but ""never thought it would come in handy in such a situation."" According to the introduction of Huang Yilin's class leader Chen Yi-yang, Huang Yi-lin is recognized as an ""honor student"" and likes to help others.","""It was so urgent,"" said Huang Yilin, who returned to her home in Mianyang, Sichuan province, in a telephone interview on August 11. ""My only thought was to save people!"" Eileen Huang is a 2015 student at the School of Landscape Architecture, Central South China University of Science and Technology. Huang Yilin, who studies urban and rural planning, wanted to visit Langzhong in Sichuan to learn about local architectural design, so the family went on a trip. On August 8, around 10 o'clock in the morning, Huang Yilin's father rested in the hotel, the mother and daughter came out to prepare to stroll the Langzhong ancient city. Just go not far away, suddenly see a group of people shouting, out of curiosity and then stepped forward. Seeing the ""little boy has disappeared, the little girl in the water desperately flutter, the river only revealed her little head, from time to time to sink,"" a child learned to swim Huang Yilin hurriedly jumped down to save people. After entering the water, the 165cm Huang Yilin found that she could not walk to the end of the road!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Seemingly calm before the surface of the water, but underneath the torrent! But she was still desperate to swim to the little girl. Huang said the river was muddy and fast-flowing, less than five meters away and it took almost all her strength. She pushed the little girl as hard as she could to the bank of the river. ""The slope was so slippery that I was afraid I wouldn't have the strength to go down."" So Huang Yilin asked for help from her mother, heard her daughter's cry for help, and Ms. Yin, who was not in good water, prepared to go into the water to rescue her, and was stopped by the tourists next to her. August 10, Huang Yilin jumped into the river to save people after the news spread, Ms. Yin received a lot of friends and family condolences, praise, but also by many friends and family ""accountability."" ""In retrospect it was really scary! To tell you the truth, my heart broke when the child could hardly hold out on the riverbank and asked for my help."" Ms. Yin said with fright that even though it was dangerous, she would still support her daughter's choice if she was in a scene like that again, and she was proud of her daughter! Being forced, Huang rarely volunteered to go back into the water after learning to swim, ""not expecting the skill to really come in handy."" According to Huang Yilin's class monitor Chen Yilin, Huang Yilin is recognized as a ""school bully"" in the class, and is willing to help others.",human_b,mt

Sunscreen packaging is generally marked SPF and PA, SPF refers to the sun protection index, is for UVB ultraviolet rays, our common SPF index is 15, 30, 50, and so on. The products labeled PA are for UVA, which makes sunscreens more effective. Typically, the strength of PA is expressed as +, and an additional + indicates an extended period of effective protection.

Those with dry skin should use sunscreen cream and those with neutral skin are not bound with any rules. Any type of skin care products is not good for those with sensitive skin and a 100% pure sunscreen is recommended. It takes time for the sunscreen to seep in thus do not forget to apply the sunscreen 30 minutes beforehand. During the long military training, be sure to apply sunscreen once every two hours to keep it effective. Don't get lazy. The skin is exposed greatly to the sun during military training thus do not use skin whitening products right away.

Today, an average of 100,000 people come to Zhushan each year, to look for innovation or seek inner peace. In fact, the relationship between the countryside and the city should be in harmony like mothers and children. There should be no division of strength and weakness and no need to be governed by others. It should be a mutual relationship that is heartwarming. There is no fixed template for rural development but it is difficult for the township to take on the change itself. The most important point is probably having the right person go to the township.","In the revival of old residences and successful village entrepreneurship cases, He Peijun gave a very good demonstration: Inheritance of a century-old home and the telling of a story on the inheritance of a piece of land. To date, about 100,000 people will visit Zhushan every year, some bring various kinds of creativity, while others seek inner solace. In fact, the rural-urban relationship should be one of companionship, like mother and child, without the difference between strong and weak, without requiring who was to govern whom; it should be very warm.

There is also room for the income of professional farmers to grow each year as well. Shares have been quantified and distributed to every villager.

The semifinals of the women's doubles has been decided and the matchups will be: Muguruza/Suárez Navarro vs Makarova/Vesnina, Šafářová/Strýcová vs Errani/Vinci. The semifinals for the mixed doubles was also decided today but the disqualification of the top seed Mahut/Garcia and the withdrawal of the Nadal pair made the mixed doubles not as exciting.","The highly regarded Beijing Olympic men's singles champion and Spanish superstar Nadal beat his opponent in straight sets to advance to the final eight in the men's singles competition on the same day, and the men's doubles competition also advanced to the final. Nadal, who is a gold slam winner with a penchant for the Olympics and has not recovered from his injuries, made the cut in a three-way strike. He and teammate Lopez will compete for the gold medal in the men's doubles final against Romania's Tecau and Megea. The women's singles event at the Rio Olympics suffered a number of seeded withdrawals, with all four of the women's singles produced on Monday after several days of intense competition.

1d,47,cd,7,62,799:809,根据重庆市气象局门户网对各区县高温天气的统计，除酉阳外，我市其余各地都能领取到不同程度的高温津贴。 目前全国至少已有28个省份明确了津贴发放标准，不过各省市发放的标准并不一样，而重庆则是按高温工作日津贴的方式领取高温津贴。 35℃以上37℃以下的，按每人每天不低于10元标准发放；37℃以上的，按每人每天不低于15元标准发放。 40℃以上高温工作人员每月最多可领20元/天的津贴（劳动者已经依法享受高温作业岗位津贴的除外）。 按照这一标准，上个月高温天气天数最多的开州能领到330元，天数最少的城口则是80元，而酉阳最高温由于没达到高温标准外，所以没有高温津贴。 以往不少单位会以清凉饮品冲抵高温津贴，市安监局表示这种行径不合乎现行办法。 因高温天气停止工作、缩短工作时间的，用人单位不得扣除或降低劳动者工资。 市人社局表示，员工遇到高温下作业却没收到高温津贴的，可通过企业所在的劳动争议调解机构争取合法权益，或拨打12333投诉。 有用人单位拒不发放高温津贴的，劳动者可向用工所在地县级以上人力资源社会保障主管部门投诉。 同时由于高温津贴是工资的一部分，不是福利，要纳入工资总额、扣减个税。 因此高温津贴不在最低工资范围内，必须以现金形式发放，不能用饮料等实物代替。,"According to the Chongqing Meteorological Bureau portal to the high temperature of the counties statistics, in addition to Youyang, the rest of the city can receive different degrees of high temperature allowance. At least 28 provinces across the country have now clarified the criteria for the payment of allowances, although the criteria are not the same in the provinces and municipalities, while Chongqing receives a high-temperature allowance in the form of a high-temperature working day allowance. If the temperature is above 35 ° C and below 37 ° C, the standard is not less than 10 yuan per person per day, and if the temperature is above 37 ° C, the standard is not less than 15 yuan per person per day. High temperature workers above 40 ℃ are entitled to a monthly allowance of up to 20 yuan / day (except for those workers who have already enjoyed the post allowance for high temperature operation in accordance with the law). According to this standard, last month, the highest number of days of hot weather in Kaizhou can receive 330 yuan, the number of days the least Chengkou is 80 yuan, and Youyang the highest temperature due to not meet the high temperature standards, so there is no high temperature allowance. In the past, many units would offset the high temperature allowance with refreshing drinks. The City Safety Supervision Bureau said that this practice was not in line with the current practice. The employing units shall not deduct or reduce the wages of the workers if they stop working or shorten their working hours due to the hot weather. The city's social service bureau said employees who have not received a high temperature allowance for working in high temperatures can fight for their legitimate rights and interests through the labor dispute mediation agency where the business is located, or call 12333 to lodge a complaint. If an employing unit refuses to pay a high-temperature allowance, the worker may file a complaint with the department in charge of human resources and social security at or above the county level in the place where the employee is employed. At the same time, since the high temperature allowance is part of the salary and not a benefit, it is included in the total salary and deducted from the tax. The high temperature allowance is therefore not covered by the minimum wage and must be paid in cash and cannot be substituted in kind, such as beverages.","According to statistics of the Chongqing Municipal Meteorological Bureau portal on the high-temperature weather in various districts and counties except Fuyang, the rest of the city may have a deviance on the high temperature. Currently, there are at least 28 provinces in China that have clearly defined the standards for the subsidy. However, the standards issued by provinces and cities are not the same. Chongqing, on one other hand, receives heat allowances in the form of heat allowances on weekdays. If the temperature is 35°C to 37°C , a rate of not less than 10 yuan per person per day; if it exceeds 37°C, the rate shall not be less than 15 yuan per person per day. Workers working in high temperature environment above 40°C can receive up to 20 yuan per day per month (except for laborers who already receive the heat allowance according to law). According to this standard, Kaizhou, had the most days of high-temperature weather last month, and was able to receive 330 yuan, and Chengkou had the least number of days which equated to 80 yuan. The highest temperature recorded in Puyang did not reach the high temperature standard, so there was no heat allowance. In the past, many would give cold drinks instead of heat allowances. The City Work Safety Administration stated that such practices are not in line with current regulations. The employer may not deduct or reduce the wages of workers due to the stoppage of work due to high temperature and reduce working hours. The Municipal Bureau of Human Resources and Social Affairs stated that when an employee faces a situation where a the work environment is considered high-temperature but does not receive a heat allowance, he or she can seek legal rights through the labor dispute mediation agency where the company is located, or call 12333 to file a complaint. Where a company refuses to issue a heat allowance, the laborer may complain to the appropriate department in human resources and social security at or above the county level where the employment is located. Also, because heat allowances are part of wages and not benefits, they must be included in total wages and deducted from taxes. Therefore, the heat allowance is not part of the minimum wage and must be paid in cash. It cannot be replaced with physical items such as drinks.",mt,human_b

These navigation channels are part of the Grand Canal.  The costs for the upgrades and reconstruction for these two will be covered with social financing, and the costs have been approved by the appropriate departments of the provincial government.  The Laowanfu River passes through Jinxiang and Yutai before linking with the Grand Canal through Nanyang Lake. Laowanfu River is a total of 32.5 kilometers. According to navigation requirements, the Laowanfu River waterway will need to adopt a proper maintenance method, deepen the water level, and straighten the channel, to improve the navigation conditions.  The waterway that goes through Jinxiang County and Rencheng District which then enters the main navigation channel of the Grand Canal via Nanyang Lake is 19 kilometers long. The work on the two channels started in February 2011 and was completed in January 2015. The principal for the investment and construction was by the Jining City Anping Canal Logistics Service Center. Based on the “paying off loans with a service fee” principle, the Anping Canal Logistics Service Center of Jining City will collect toll fees subject to the standards approved by the Shandong Provincial Price Bureau. One of such standard is the base toll calculated at 1.75 yuan/dwt, and a toll mileage of 0.05 yuan/km dwt. The toll collection period is from June 15, 2016 to June 14th, 2019. Reporters learned from the Jining City Port and Navigation Bureau that there are currently 4 tolled waterway in Jining consisting of Weishui River, Baima River, Beidake River, and Laowanfu River. The 4 waterways are tributaries of the Grand Canal and were upgraded via social financing. The Weishui River upgrade project was the first to feature the collaborative ""Government + Market"" model for waterway improvement in the Shangdong Province. The Government funded most of it while social funding was used to cover the balance. Baima River, Laowanfu River and Beidake River projects were done purely for the interest of the market. The budget allocated from the state finance is not enough to cover the cost of the project construction, and would impede on the upgrade progress of the channels. The use of social funding for the construction of public infrastructure meets the requirements of national policies and has also become a way to overcome funding issues.","The upgraded and reconstructed tributary navigation channels of the Beijing-Hangzhou Grand Canal, namely Laowanfu River and Beidaliu navigation channels, have started to collect a toll on September 1. The two branch navigation routes will be constructed by means of social financing. The funds have been approved by relevant departments of the provincial government. The navigation channel of Laowanfu River has a total length of 32.5 km, flowing through Jinxiang and Yutai before entering, via Nanyang Lake, the Grand Canal (Beijing-Hangzhou Grand Canal). Based on navigational requirements, the Laowanfu River channel has adopted a method of maintenance and reconstruction, having partially dredged the riverbed to increase its depth, and partially straightening sharp bends in the river, among others. Conditions of the shipping channel have improved. This navigation channel has a total length of 19 km, flowing through Jinxiang County, Rencheng District, and entering, via Nanyang Lake, the Grand Canal. Constructions to renovate the two navigational channels began in February 2011, and were completed in January 2015 for inspections. The Jining City Anping Canal Logistic Service Center is the primary investor and operator of the channels. According to the "" Build by loan, Charge to repay"" principle, Anping Canal Logistic Service Center will charge the passage toll according to the rated approved by Shandong Price Bureau. Of which, a basic transportation fee is charged at 1.75 RMB/ton carried. Mileage transportation fee is charged at 0.05 RMB/km for each ton carried. Toll collection hours will begin on June 15, 2016 and end on June 14, 2019. From the Jining Maritime and Port Bureau, the reporter learned that there are 4 paid navigation channels within Jining, namely Zhushui River, Baima River, Beidaliu, and Laowanfu River navigation channels. The four shipping lanes are tributary channels of the Beijing-Hangzhou Grand Canal, and were upgraded and reconstructed by way of public financing. The project for upgrading and reconstructing the Zhushui River navigation channel is a first time attempt to use a ""government + market"" model. The project is an infrastructure undertaking for river ports in Shandong Province, with the government being the main investor while social investments make up for the gap in funding required. Baima River, Laowanfu River, Beidaliu River and other tributary navigational channels have adopted a pure market-based operating approach. The funds provided by the national budget could not satisfy construction costs, limiting the progress for navigation route upgrades. Social capital used for constructing public infrastructure is compliant to national policy requirements, and has become a means to resolve the capital bottleneck.",human_b,human_a

When fully-grown, the shark can reach a length of 4 to 5 meters. The Greenland shark grows at a extremely slow rate, only 1 cm per year sometimes, suggesting a particularly long lifespan. Traditional dating methods often use calcified tissues of animals. Fin spines may used in some sharks but this type of calcified tissue is extremely rare in Greenland sharks. New research led by Julius Nielsen of Denmark's University of Copenhagen used the lens of the eyes of the Greenland shark to carry out radiocarbon dating. This method has been used before to determine the age of a whale, but is used, for the first time, to determine the age of a shark and similar types of fish. Their analysis indicated that the largest shark has an age of about 392 years, with a standard error of about 120 years. This means that this shark is at least 272 years old, and could be as old as 512 years old. A female Greenland Shark must reach a length of about 4 meters to reach reproductive maturity. When converted to actual age, she must be at least 156 years old before she is mature.

In addition, the female Greenland shark is said to be ready to mate when it is about 4 meters in length, which equates to an age of at least 156 before reaching adulthood.

This responsibility is not only the physical well-being, but also mental development which is education. If you succeed in your business but disregard your child's education, it will not be enough to makeup for the failure of your life and family. When a child is born, new fathers and mothers needs to be responsible and spend time to look after and educate the child. Responsibility of a child not only covers the physical well-being but also to educate them and help them develop mentally. Basically, let the child learn how to behave, grow up, and succeed. A good family environment is one where parents will always be with the child, and take care of the child whole-heartedly. Parents also needs to teach their child how to learn and become civilized. A parent's words and actions can affect how the child grows up. As a child would imitate parent's actions, there is a Chinese saying that a dragon will come from a dragon, a phoenix will come from a phoenix, and the child of a mouse will make holes, which basically means the whatever the parents do, the child will do the same. Therefore, parents have to a good role-model for their child. Parent's should strive to improve themselves and be careful of what you say and do as they can all cultivate a child's good character and become a better person.","After a baby is born, parents must assume responsibility for this life. This responsibility does not merely concern the physical health of the child but also mental development, i.e. education. Failing in children's education is a loss in life and family that cannot be compensated by success in career-building. When a life is born, the new parents must spend time and effort to take care and educate the child, and be responsible to it. To become responsible, in addition to caring for the body, providing them with a healthy and spiritual education, the children are taught how to socialize properly, become responsible adults, and gain success. Good family education means that parents must spend time with their children often and provide them with love, patient care, and teach them how to develop well-mannered speech and behavior, allowing children to achieve better learning and improvements to their mental skills. Every saying and act of parents will influence the development of their child. The child will often mimic their parents, just like the traditional saying that goes: ""A dragon gives birth to a dragon, a phoenix gives rise to a phoenix. A rat's child will eventually learn to dig holes."" The child will take after its parents. Parents must provide a good role model in front of their children, control their words and saying, and develop an excellent character of their own.

Huang Yilin is a student from Central South University of Forestry and Technology for the class of 2015. Huang Yilin, who was studying urban and rural planning, wanted to visit Sichuan Zhongzhong to learn about the local architectural design, thus travelled together with her family. At around 10:00 on August 8, Huang Yilin’s father was resting at the hotel, while Huang Yilin and her mom went out to walk around Langzhong Ancient City. Without venturing too far, they saw a group of people yelling and screaming thus went up to see what the commotion was about. She saw that ""the boy was already out of sight and the girl was desperately trying to stay above water with only half her head visible as her head bobbled up and down in the river"". Huang Yilin had learned how to swim when she was young and jumped in quickly to save the child. After diving in, Huang Yilin realized that despite being 165 cm tall, her feet could not touch the bottom of the river!  Although the surface of the river seemed calm, the current was strong underneath!  But she was still determined to swim toward the girl. Huang Yilin said that the river was muddy and turbulent and she had to use almost all her strength to reach the girl who was less than 5 meters away. She tried her best to push the little girl to the edge of the river bank. ""The slope was very slippery and I was afraid that I would use up my energy and sink."" Huang Yilin called out to her mom for help. Her mom heard her cry for help and was about to go in the water and help. However as her mom was not in proper attire, she was stopped by a tourist beside her. On August 10th, after Huang Yilin jumped in the river to save the child, her mom was bombarded with comments, compliments, and ""questions"" from friends and relatives. ""If you look back at it now, it was really scary! To be honest, when she could barely hold on to the riverbank and called to me for help, my heart almost shattered."" Ms. Yin said that despite being dangerous, she would still support her daughter's decision if something like this happened again. She was very proud of her daughter!  Because Huang Yilin was forced to learn swimming, she never really swam after learning how to swim but ""never thought it would come in handy in such a situation."" According to the introduction of Huang Yilin's class leader Chen Yi-yang, Huang Yi-lin is recognized as an ""honor student"" and likes to help others.","On August 11, when the reporter's telephone interview reached Huang Yilin who has returned to her home at Jinyang in Sichuan, she said: ""It was an emergency. The only thing I could think of is to rescue people."" Huang Yiling is a student of the 2015 cohort of the Landscape Architecture School in the Central South University Forestry and Technology. Huang Yilin who is now studying the professional field of town and country planning wishes to visit Langzhong in Sichuan to learn about architecture in that region, and thus took the entire family to a trip to that location. At about 10 am on August 8, Huang Yilin's father was resting at the hotel, while she and her mother were getting ready to wander about Langzhong Ancient City. After walking for a short distance, they saw a small crowd screaming and yelling, and approached them out of curiosity. Seeing that the ""little boy has disappeared and that the little girl is splashing around in the water, with her head bobbing up and down the river water as the water keeps dragging her down"", Huang Yilin, who had learned swimming at a young age, jumped into the water to save the child. After jumping into the river, 165-meter tall Huang Yilin realized she could not find the bottom! The water surface which seemed serene previously hid powerful currents underneath. But she did everything she could to swim toward the little girl. Huang Yilin said that the river was muddy and rapid. She was almost spent swimming a distance of less than 5 meters. She used her entire strength to push the little girl to the side of the levee. ""The slope is so slipper. I thought I might sink when I run out of power."" Huang Yilin therefore cried out to her mother for help. Upon hearing her daughter's cries, Mdm Yin, who was not a good swimmer, decided to go into the water but was stopped by other swimmers. On August 10, after the story of Huang Yilin leaping into the river to save a girl spread, Mdm Yin received plenty of words of comfort and praise from family members and friends, as well as ""blame"" from many. "" I still feel the linger fear! To tell you the truth, my heart was broken when the kid almost fading on the bank cried out for help. Fear still lingered in Mdm Yin's heart. Despite the dangers, Mdm Yin said that she would still support the choice made by her daughter under such circumstances and felt proud for what she did. Huang Yilin seldom took the initiative to go swimming after she learned the skill because she was forced into it. ""Who would have thought it would come in handy."" According to Huang Yilin's class monitor Chen Yiyang, the class has long regarded Huang Yilin as the ""top-scoring student"" and knew that she is willing to help others.",human_b,human_a

These navigation channels are part of the Grand Canal.  The costs for the upgrades and reconstruction for these two will be covered with social financing, and the costs have been approved by the appropriate departments of the provincial government.  The Laowanfu River passes through Jinxiang and Yutai before linking with the Grand Canal through Nanyang Lake. Laowanfu River is a total of 32.5 kilometers. According to navigation requirements, the Laowanfu River waterway will need to adopt a proper maintenance method, deepen the water level, and straighten the channel, to improve the navigation conditions.  The waterway that goes through Jinxiang County and Rencheng District which then enters the main navigation channel of the Grand Canal via Nanyang Lake is 19 kilometers long. The work on the two channels started in February 2011 and was completed in January 2015. The principal for the investment and construction was by the Jining City Anping Canal Logistics Service Center. Based on the “paying off loans with a service fee” principle, the Anping Canal Logistics Service Center of Jining City will collect toll fees subject to the standards approved by the Shandong Provincial Price Bureau. One of such standard is the base toll calculated at 1.75 yuan/dwt, and a toll mileage of 0.05 yuan/km dwt. The toll collection period is from June 15, 2016 to June 14th, 2019.

The 4 waterways are tributaries of the Grand Canal and were upgraded via social financing. The Weishui River upgrade project was the first to feature the collaborative ""Government + Market"" model for waterway improvement in the Shangdong Province. The Government funded most of it while social funding was used to cover the balance. Baima River, Laowanfu River and Beidake River projects were done purely for the interest of the market. The budget allocated from the state finance is not enough to cover the cost of the project construction, and would impede on the upgrade progress of the channels. The use of social funding for the construction of public infrastructure meets the requirements of national policies and has also become a way to overcome funding issues.","After the upgrading of the Beijing-Hangzhou Grand Canal branch channel old Wanfu River, Beidaliao Channel from September 1 to collect tolls. The two tributary waterways are reformed and constructed by means of social financing, and the fees have been approved by the relevant departments of the provincial government.

The iPhone 7 is really going to come out. Although Apple did not comment, information and specification of the new iPhone has been released and there are ""actual"" photos of the iPhone 7 on the web. The new generation of the iPhone is going to be slick, popular, and limited, thus if you want to be one of the first one to get a hold of it, be sure to know where to buy it from...like Suning. ""This has led to further disappointment in the new phone. It is longer but can't even take videos. This generation of iPhone is terrible."" Like the other iPhones, iPhone 7 had its share of secrets before being released. In addition, there are multiple sources claiming that the new generation of iPhone will not feature a 3.5mm headphone jack and use Bluetooth connectivity instead and will just have the charging port. This will provide space for Apple to add a second speaker. As evidence to backup this claim, Apple had developed earphones that would connect to the charging port back in 2014. Regardless of whether the rumors are true or not, we will only know for sure when it is announced in Apple's fall 2016 conference. However, this does not prevent the industry from looking at the potential specification of the iPhone 7 - many believe that the iPhone 7 will most likely be Apple's last major upgrade to the iPhone series. IDC, which is a market research institute recently released data that the market share of iPhone has declined. However, Goldman Sachs will maintain the ""buy"" rating for Apple's stock, and BMO analysts believe that iPhone7 will come together with a historic sales performance. Additionally, Broadcom’s CEO Hock Tan also stated that Apple’s future revenue growth may exceed 20%, all thanks to the launch of the iPhone 7. Seven percent of respondents said they had plans to purchase the iPhone 7, compared to only four percent who planned to purchase the iPhone 6 two years ago. It is understood that 20% of those currently using the iPhone 6 or 6 Plus plan to purchase the iPhone 7, which is a very high percentage. Also, experts analyzed that most of Apple consumers like to replace their iPhones every generation. According to the data, about 26% of all iPhone users have not changed their phones for 2 years. Which means almost 120 million people have used the iPhone for 2 years. Some media claimed that Taiwan faced several earthquakes during the production of iPhone 7 and, “The damage of TSMC's production facilities was bigger than expected and may affect the initial iPhone 7 supply.” The disparity between supply and demand will affect the average customers. It is time to choose a good place to buy an authentic iPhone 7 early at a lower price. According to informed sources, Suning executives met frequently with Apple in order to prepare enough stock. The company is already in discussion with Suning, and will inevitable provide a lower price and better service for consumers through a high-level of cooperation between the two parties. “At the lowest price, consumers may only need to pay 7 yuan a day to purchase the iPhone 7.” Plentiful stock and various services will make purchasing the iPhone less stressful. Through Suning's logistics, will further lead to a heightened buying experience. You may perhaps get a call in the middle of a night which will say ""Hi this is Suning.com. Your iPhone 7 is here.""","Although it has yet to be proven, many information sources indicate that Apple will hold its 2016 Fall event in September. iPhone 7 is really on its way. Although Apple did not respond, news concerning the functions and configuration of the iPhone are being released gradually. Pictures of the ""actual phone model"" have even appeared on the Internet. The new iPhone could be considered a ""public phenomenon"". It's popular, sleek, and could not be acquired even if you have the money to pay for it. If you want to buy an original product, you must opt for a proper sales channel such as Suning. This heightened the people's sense of disappointment for the new cellphone. ""It became longer, but couldn't project holographs! This iPhone release sucks."" Like other iPhones, numerous anecdotes and secret information accompanied the iPhone 7 before its debut. Elsewhere, many sources of information also claimed that the 3.5mm headphone jack will be removed from the new iPhone to be replaced by bluetooth connection and the charging interface. This will give Apple room for adding a second speaker. Another piece of corroborative evidence is that as far back as 2014, Apple had already allowed headphone manufacturers to connect headphone products through the charging interface. The answer to such news, whether true or false, will only be revealed by Apple at the 2016 Fall launch event. This did not stop industry insiders from taking a positive view of the prospects of iPhone 7 however. Many believed that iPhone 7 could very well be the last time Apple would significantly upgrade the iPhone series. However, data recently published by IDC, a market intelligence firm, showed the market share of iPhone has decreased slightly. Goldman Sachs has rated Apple shares as something that can be ""bought"". BMO analysts believe that iPhone7 will establish a historical record in sales performance. Broadcom CEO Hock Tan also expressed that Apple is expected to achieve more than 20% growth in revenue. This figure can be completely attributed to the release of iPhone7. 7% of those interviewed said they intend to buy iPhone 7 compared to a mere 4% who planned to buy iPhone 6 two years ago. From information available, 20% of users currently holding an iPhone6 or 6Plus have plans for purchasing iPhone7. This proportion is quite substantial. Next, experts analyzed that most Apple fans like to replace their iPhone every other generation. Statistics revealed that among iPhone users, approximately 26% of users have not changed their mobile phones in two years, i.e., the iPhones of about 120 million users have been used for two years. Some media reported that Taiwan has been hit by several earthquakes during the iPhone7 production period. ""Damages sustained by TSMC production facilities may have went beyond expectations, and that could have influenced initial supply for iPhone7."" Supply and demand conflicts will influence normal users. It is time to select a proper channel and acquire an authentic iPhone7 early at a low price. Insider disclosure revealed that the upper management of Suning and Apple has met frequently in recent times for the purpose of preparing enough resources. Service operators have reached an agreement with Suning. It can be expected that with growing partnership between the two, users will be provided with lower prices and more dedicated services. "" The lowest price. The customers might' only RMB 7 a day to get a iPhone7"". Sufficient supply of goods and a variety of discounts, buyers of iPhone 7 will not be so stressed out, and Suning's logistics department will all the more turn this happiness into a more intuitive experience. Perhaps you will receive a phone call at midnight. ""Hello, this is Suning.com. Your iPhone 7 has arrived.""",human_b,human_a

UV rays not only darkens your skin but can also cause sunburn. So how does one get through the rigorous military training without sunburn? Sunscreen generally features a SPF and PA mark. SPF is the measure of how well a sunscreen protects the skin from sunburn, and protect the skin from UVB rays. The common figures we see are SPF of 15, 30 and 50. Products with the PA mark is for UVA rays thus is a more effective sun screen. The strength of the PA is shown with + signs, and any additional + signs represents longer protection time. Those with oily skin should choose water-based sunscreen for deep protection. Sunscreen spray is also a good choice. Those with dry skin should use sunscreen cream and those with neutral skin are not bound with any rules. Any type of skin care products is not good for those with sensitive skin and a 100% pure sunscreen is recommended. It takes time for the sunscreen to seep in thus do not forget to apply the sunscreen 30 minutes beforehand. During the long military training, be sure to apply sunscreen once every two hours to keep it effective. Don't get lazy. The skin is exposed greatly to the sun during military training thus do not use skin whitening products right away. After military training, if possible, wrap ice cubes with a towel and apply it to your burnt skin to cool it down.","Although autumn has arrived, the bite of the ""autumn tiger"" has proved to be no less powerful than that of the summer. UV not only darkens the skin, it will also cause sunburns. Is there any solution to help the skin make it through military training and avoid sunburns altogether? The external packaging of sunblock cream is often labeled with SPF and PA. SPF refers to the sun protection factor and specifically targets UVB radiation. Common SPF scores include 15, 30, and 50. Products with the PA label are aimed at UVA. Such sunblocks are more effective. Generally, the strength of PA is indicated by the + sign. Each additional + represents a longer duration of effective protection. For oily skin, choose aqueous sunblock with good penetrability. Sunblock sprays are good options as well. For dry skin, use cream-based anti-sunburn products. Those with neutral skin are not subject to stringent regulations. However, sensitive skin will find application of any product to be a hard burden. Purely physical sunblock products are recommended. Remember to apply the sunblock cream half an hour earlier as the anti-sunburn product needs some time before completely penetrating the skin. Military training includes extended exposure to solar radiation. Anti-sunburn cream must be applied once every 2 hours to sustain the effects. Don't get lazy about this. Since the skin has just been sensitized by exposure to the sun, do not use whitening products immediately after military training. For sunburns endured during military training, ice wrapped in towels can be used to cool scorched skin and alleviate local senses of over-heating.",human_b,human_a

2d,21,fd,24,78,984:999,从表面上看，网络社交平台扩大了交际圈，降低了人们的孤独感。 网络社交的势力范围越发广泛，不仅逐渐取代传统的电话联络，甚至渗入到线下真实的生活圈，悄然改变当下民众的社交生活。 线上社交的好处是显而易见的，比如方便快捷，所以特别容易受到年轻族群的青睐。 一项针对大学生社交习惯的调查显示，57%的大学生每天使用手机的时间超过5小时，日常生活基本“机不离手”。 “社交网络具有低成本、传输速度快、多人同时交流等特点，符合当代大学生的需求。” 扩大人际关系圈，更平等地对话，避免社交顾虑，才是我们越发深爱线上聊的主要原因。 刚进公司的新人热爱跟同事线上交流，“因为才进单位大家不太熟，通过社交平台的点赞评论，关系才比以前近了许多”。 爱交友的也常用线上交流，“之前跟朋友因为一些误会有段时间没联络了，后来在一个大群里先对话几句才又热络起来。” IT工程师吴言是深度网络社交爱好者，他大部分的社交生活都发生于线上，网络联系人更数倍于线下朋友圈人数。 吴言自己也坦言在网络上更“如鱼得水”。 “可以在自己方便愿意的时候回复朋友，因为有很多斟酌字句的时间，表述也能更清楚。” “隐藏在ID之下的你来我往避免了面对面的人际碰撞，不仅有了回旋的余地，甚至给了彼此更多思忖言行的时间和空间。” “不同身份的人有了同样发言的权利和效率，现实生活中的种种社交顾虑，在网络空间似乎都一下消除。” 然而吴言的朋友小鹏却觉得，生活中的吴言是个“蛮无趣的宅男”。 小鹏和吴言在一个大群里相识，因为两人都是积极发言者，很快就熟络起来了。 小鹏觉得吴言跟网络上判若两人，言语枯燥，也不主动发表意见，翻来覆去就是几句“呵呵，好的，是吗”，要不就是“这个我要上网查一下”。,"On the surface, the social networking platform has expanded the circle of communication and reduced people's loneliness. The social circle of cyberspace has become more and more common. It has not only gradually replaced the traditional means of communication by phone, but is also affecting our social circles. It is quietly changing the social lives of people. The benefits of social networking online are obvious, such as the convenience, and especially cater to the young generation. A survey on college students’ social habits shows that 57% of college students spend more than five hours a day using mobile phones, and it has become inseparable with their daily lives. ""The social network has the characteristics of inexpensive, fast, and being able to network with a large crowd, which is in line with the needs of college students today."" Expanding the circle of interpersonal relationships, a more equal dialogue, and avoiding social concerns are the main reasons why we love chatting online more. New company staffs likes to communicate with their coworkers online. ""As many are not familiar with it, they communicated without borders which built a good relationship among them."" People who like to make friends also like to use this. ""There was an instance where I had lost contact with someone due to a misunderstanding. However I was able to connect with that person again by conversing in groups."" Wu Yan, an IT engineer, is an in-depth social networking enthusiast. Most of his social life happens online, where the number of people online is several times more than those offline. Wu Yan admits that being online is ""like being a fish in the water"". ""You can reply your friends at your own pace. You will be able to express yourself better as you have time to think about what to write."" ""You can stay behind your online ID and avoid face-to-face conflict; will have the peace of mind to think things out before taking action."" ""Two different people can come together and communicate at the same level. Thus the social concerns in real life seem to be non-existent online."" However, Wu’s friend Xiaopeng thinks that Wu’s life is enclosed and abnormal. Xiaopeng and Wu Yan met in a large group and as they were both active talkers, they quickly became good friends. Xiaopeng felt that Wu Yan and two other people online were bland and did not actively express their opinions. Their replies were often ""Oh, ok, really,"" or ""Let me check online.""","On the surface, social networking platforms have widened the social circle and reduced loneliness. The scope of influence of online social networking has become increasingly widespread. Not only has it gradually replaced traditional phone communication, it has even permeated actual offline living circles, quietly changing the social activities of the masses. The benefit of online social networking is obvious. It is easy and convenient, and is therefore much preferred by younger demographics. A survey investigating college student socializing habits found that 57% of college students spend more than 5 hours a day on cellphones, literally making cellphones ""inseparable"" during everyday lives. ""The characteristics of social networks include being low-cost, having fast transmission rates, and allowing many people to interact simultaneously. This suits the needs of contemporary university students. Expanded relationship circles, being able to chat on equal footing, and avoidance of social stigma are the main reasons why we become increasingly fond of online chat. The newcomers enjoy online communication with other employees, "" because we are not familiar with each other at the beginning. But the 'like' and comment in the social media will close the distance."" People who enjoy making friends also used online networking. ""I haven't been contacting a friend for a while due to some misunderstanding. We then shared a few words in a larger group and things got better from there."" IT engineer Wu Yan is strong fan for social networking, and spends most of his socializing time and life online, with many more online contacts than friends he meet offline. Wu Yan himself honestly said that he feels like ""fish returned to the water"" when he goes online. ""You may reply to a friend when you are willing at a time that is convenient for you to do so because there is plenty of time for you to deliberate the wordings, and you can also express yourself more clearly."" ""The ID provides one with a cover to avoid all face-to-face interpersonal conflicts, providing one with more room to maneuver and also provided both sides with more time and space to think about what they say."" ""People of different status are given the same rights to speech and the same voice. Various social taboos in real life seem to disappear in the online world."" Xiaopeng, a friend of Wu Yan, felt that the real life Wu Yan is a ""boring geek"". Xiaopeng and Wu Yan met in a big group. As they were both active speakers, they became acquainted very quickly. Xiaopeng felt that Wu Yan was completely different from his online personality. The real Wu Yan used little words and never gave any opinions. The only phrases he would use were: ""Ho ho. Alright. Really?"" or ""I'll check that online.""",human_b,human_a
2d,22,ed,27,118,1491:1506,可惜，OPEC最新月报显示出7月原油产量继续增加，沙特产量更创下新高。 这份报告不禁令市场对OPEC的信誉产生怀疑，油价复苏的道路恐怕仍然布满荆棘。 本周一，OPEC轮值主席兼卡塔尔能源大臣萨达表示，OPEC将在9月26-28日的国际能源论坛期间举行非正式会议。 OPEC周三公布的月报显示，包括加蓬在内的整个OPEC组织7月产量上升4.6万桶/日，至3311万桶/日。 OPEC还在月报中表示，原油价格低廉已促使全球炼油商生产更多精炼油品，从而加重了市场供应过剩的程度。 受此消息影响，再加上美国上调原油产量预期和原油库存意外增加，国际油价连续两日收跌。 截至周三收盘，纽约商品交易所9月交货的轻质原油期货价格下跌2.48%，10月交货的伦敦布伦特原油期货价格下跌2.07%。 路透社认为，提议召开的产油国会议不太可能令供应明显收紧，美国能源信息署公布的数据也打压市场人气。 伊朗官方通讯社Fars周三援引伊朗石油部长赞加内的发言称，伊朗的日原油产量最高为385万桶，这是2008年以来的最高水平。 召开会议的消息刚出，俄罗斯能源部长诺瓦克就表示，当前油价下没有进行新一轮冻产谈判的必要。 上次产油国召开会议已经是4月份的事情，OPEC成员国未能就任何措施达成协议。 BMIResearch石油与天然气分析师理查兹（Emma Richards）表示，市场和媒体可能对OPEC将召开的会议反应过度。 加拿大皇家银行大宗商品策略主管克罗夫特（Helima Croft）表示，OPEC通过释放他们将促成协议的信号来改变市场的情绪。 这个手段就像是引开人视线的烟雾与镜子（故意给人错误印象）。 德国商业银行大宗商品研究主管温伯格（Eugen Weinberg）称，人们认为OPEC试图通过9月会议稳定市场的可能性很低。 这很可能进一步破坏市场对OPEC的信心，毕竟这个组织上演过一次“狼来了”。,"Unfortunately, the latest OPEC monthly report shows that crude oil production continued to increase in July, and Saudi Arabia's production hit a new high. This report doesn't prevent the market from doubting OPEC. The road to recovery for oil price seems to be a tough one. On Monday, Sada who is OPEC's president and Qatar's Energy Minister said that OPEC will hold an informal meeting during the International Energy Forum on September 26-28. The monthly report released by OPEC on Wednesday showed that all OPEC members including Gabon increased their July production by an additional 46,000 barrels per day to 33.11 million barrels per day. OPEC also said in its monthly report that low crude oil prices have prompted the world's refiners to produce more refined oil products, which has increased the level of excess supply in the market.

As of Wednesday's close, the New York Mercantile Exchange's September delivery of light crude oil futures fell 2.48%, and the October delivery of London Brent crude oil futures fell 2.07%. Reuters believes that the proposed meeting of oil-producing countries is unlikely to significantly tighten supply, and data released by the US Energy Information Administration also weighed on market sentiment. Iran’s official news agency Fars quoted Iran’s oil minister Zaganga’s statement on Wednesday, saying that Iran’s maximum daily crude oil output was 3.85 million barrels, which is the highest level since 2008. The result of the meeting was just announced and the Russian Energy Minister Novak stated that there is no need for a new round of negotiations on production freeze with the current oil price. The meeting with the oil-producing country was back in April. OPEC member states were not able to reach an agreement whatsoever.  Emma Richards, an oil and gas analyst at BMI Research, said that the market and the media may be a bit too sensitive to the OPEC meeting. Helima Croft, head of commodities strategy at Royal Bank of Canada, said that OPEC changed market sentiment by releasing signals that they would facilitate the deal.

2d,27,ed,3,144,1756:1771,国家发展改革委产业协调司负责人今天在此间指出，钢铁产能过剩是全球性问题。 我国近年产能利用率均高于全球平均水平，也高于美欧等国家和地区。 我国已经采取坚决有效的措施化解过剩产能，而且成效正在逐步显现。 该负责人指出，对钢铁产能过剩这一全球性问题，党中央国务院高度重视。 各部门、各地区积极贯彻落实国务院部署，认真开展工作，今年要压减粗钢产能4500万吨左右。 从我国国情出发，我国并不鼓励钢材出口，相反，还采取一系列切实措施控制钢材出口。 这位负责人强调，钢铁产品国际贸易本质上讲是市场行为，是源于进口国需求、消费者综合考虑产品性价比等因素后的自主选择。 实施贸易保护措施无助于从根本上解决全球钢铁产业的发展问题，相反，只会对国际贸易秩序造成进一步冲击。 在谈到债务时，该负责人强调，化解债务问题是化解过剩产能过程中需要妥善处理好的重要问题。 由于钢铁企业资产规模大，涉及面广，一些企业的债务关系复杂，如果处置不当，有可能引发区域性风险。 据该负责人介绍，近年来，随着经济下行压力加大，社会总需求逐步减弱，部分行业产能利用率下降，企业生产经营困难加大。 一些企业不适应市场环境变化，生产经营难以为继甚至濒临倒闭，但受一些体制机制因素制约，以市场化方式退出的障碍较多，成为“僵尸企业”。 这类企业的存在，扭曲了市场信号，降低了要素资源利用效率，增加了社会管理成本，妨碍了公平竞争市场环境的建立。 导致亏损的主要原因与全球钢铁行业面临的困境一样——市场需求不振、产能利用率低。 我国主要采取市场机制、经济手段和法治办法，政府主要是做好职工兜底和社会稳定工作，保证公平公正的市场秩序。 这位负责人强调，下一步，要坚定不移继续抓好去产能工作，确保完成5年化解粗钢产能1亿~1.5亿吨的目标任务。,"The head of the Industrial Coordination Department of the National Development and Reform Commission said here today that steel overcapacity is a global problem. In recent years, China's capacity utilization rate is higher than the global average and higher than the United States and Europe and other countries and regions. China has taken resolute and effective measures to eliminate excess capacity, and the results are gradually emerging. The person in charge pointed out that the party Central Committee and the State Council attach great importance to the global problem of excess steel production capacity. Various departments and regions have actively implemented the State Council's plan and carried out serious work to reduce crude steel production capacity by about 45 million tons this year. Proceeding from China's national conditions, China does not encourage steel exports, on the contrary, it has also taken a series of practical measures to control steel exports. The official stressed that international trade in steel products is essentially a market behavior, is derived from the importing country demand, consumers comprehensive consideration of product value for money and other factors after the independent choice. The implementation of trade protection measures will not help to fundamentally solve the problem of the development of the global steel industry, on the contrary, it will only cause further impact on the international trade order. When talking about debt, the chief stressed that resolving the debt problem is an important issue that needs to be properly handled in the process of resolving excess capacity. Due to the large scale and wide range of assets of steel enterprises, the debt relationship of some enterprises is complex, and it is possible to trigger regional risks if not handled properly. In recent years, as downward pressure on the economy has increased, aggregate demand in society has gradually weakened, capacity utilization rates in some sectors have declined and enterprises have greater difficulties in production and operation, according to the chief. Some enterprises do not adapt to changes in the market environment, production and operation is difficult to sustain or even close down, but subject to some institutional and institutional factors, there are more obstacles to exit in a market-oriented way and become ""zombie enterprises."" The existence of such enterprises distorts market signals, reduces the efficiency of factor resource utilization, increases the cost of social management and hinders the establishment of a level playing field. The main reasons for the losses are the same as those faced by the global steel industry - weak market demand and low capacity utilisation. Our country mainly adopts the market mechanism, economic means and the method of rule of law, and the government mainly does a good job in the work of the bottom line and social stability of the staff and workers to ensure a fair and just market order. The person in charge stressed that the next step is to continue to work hard to ensure the completion of the five-year target of 100 million to 150 million tons of crude steel production capacity.","Today, the head of the Industry Coordination Department of the National Development and Reform Commission pointed out that the excess capacity of steel is a global issue. In recent years, China's capacity utilization rate has been higher than the global average. It is also higher than the United States and Europe and in other countries. China has taken quick and effective measures to resolve the issue of overproduction, and is gradually coming into effect. The person in charge pointed out that the Central Committee and the State Council excess capacity of steel is a global issue. All departments and regions actively implemented the State Council's orders and actively carried them out. The crude steel production capacity this year should be reduced by around 45 million tons. From a national standpoint, China does not encourage the export of steel products. Instead, it adopts a series of practical measures to control the export of steel products. The person in charge emphasized that international trade of steel products is a market-driven decision made by the needs of the importing country based on the price and other factors. The implementation of trade protection measures will not fundamentally solve the problem of global steel industry development. On the contrary, it will only cause further issues to the international market. The person in charge also emphasized that resolving the deficit issue is important and needs to be resolved properly and concurrently with the issue of excess capacity. As the asset and scope of steel making companies are massive, the debt issue of some companies are complex and there will be a regional risk if it is not handled appropriately. According to the person in charge, in recent years, as the pressure of economic downturn has increased, the total social demand has gradually weakened, and the capacity utilization rate of some industries has declined. As a result, the production and operation of enterprises have become increasingly difficult. Some enterprises are unable adapt to the changes in the market, thus production and management are difficult to sustain and lead to bankruptcy. However, due to the constraints of some institutional mechanisms, there are many obstacles to market-based withdrawal which leads to companies becoming ""zombie companies"". The existence of such enterprises has distorted market signals, reduced resource utilization efficiency, increased social management costs, and hindered the establishment of a fair market environment. The main cause of losses is the same as the predicament faced by the global steel industry. Basically the market demand is weak and capacity utilization is low. Our country mainly adopts market mechanisms, economic instruments, and regulations. The government mainly does a good job for all employees and provide social stability to ensure a fair market. The person in charge emphasized that in the next step, we must diligently continue to do a good job in the production capacity and ensure that the target of reducing 100 to 150 million tons of crude steel production capacity is completed in five years.",mt,human_b

The story of Grecia the toucan has been known early on in the Central American country of Costa Rica. In the press release on August 30th, Grecia who recovered from the surgery showed off her new prosthetic 3D printed beak to the public. The toucan whose beak was hacked off by humans and was dying a year and half ago is now reborn. This day not only confirms that she is 100% healthy, but also is a day when she will be relocated to a luxurious cage and a day for those who care about her to be able to see her. Grecia was a bit shy after moving to her new home but became more lively as she played in the water and ate grapes with her new beak. The engineering specialist did not newly paint the 3D printed beak to serve as a reminder to people of what she went through, thus leaving it in the original white color of the 3D printing material. The outer layer of the beak features a thin wall of keratin, and the inside is generally hollow and is only supported by several thin bone struts. Despite the interior being reinforced, the toucan's beak is still frail and can break when damaged. With the collaboration with the animal rescue center, bird specialists, and a US 3D printing company, the group was able to create several ""trial versions"" to identify and finally create ""the perfect one"". Grecia can now skillfully use her new beak to drink water, eat, and even pick up small grains. ""The design of the final product took around 2 months and the printing only took 4-5 hours."" The president of SG3D Printing, Thomas Lange explained to Xinhua International during an interview that, ""3D printing is not a technology of the future but has already stepped in to our lives"". In January 2015, a bloodied toucan (Grecia) was found on a farm in Grecia, Alajuela Province located in central Costa Rica. The beak was brutally hacked off by a group of youngsters. She could not eat at all and was in critical condition. After the media covered the story of Grecia's tragic situation, it triggered a wave of opposition on animal cruelty in and outside of Costa Rica. People have since called out for a stricter animal protection law and for harsher penalties for animal abuse. People proactively came together to do their best to help Grecia recover and regain her life before being injured. Chuck Hall who is the inventor of 3D printing was also involved in the design of Grecia's beak. ""Grecia's situation was a very special one as there was less than 1 cm of the upper jaw left, which caused many difficulties in attaching the beak."" ""We first scanned Grecia then designed an extended cap that was a bit longer than the remnant beak, then glued the prosthetic beak"". Lange told the reporters of Xinhua International that ""By doing so, we can prevent further injury for Grecia"". Before installing the prosthetic beak, the staff had to keep Grecia clean everyday to prevent infections. The story of Grecia the toucan travelled the distance and touched John Hoffman who is a producer at Discovery News Channel and Paul Heredia who is a famous documentary director. They filmed bits and pieces of the installation of Grecia's new beak to make a documentary called ""Toucan Nation"" which was aired on Animal Planet this month. The documentary ""Toucan Nation"" shows how a small Toucan inspired a nation to make changes and citizens to get involved to stop animal cruelty.","Gracia is a budding female toucan with the scent of a tropical rainforest. In the Central American country of Costa Rica, the toucan Gracia and its story have long been a household name. At a press conference on August 10, Gracia, who is recovering from surgery, finally appeared to show off her brand-new, 3D printed plastic beak. The dying toucan, which had its beak snapped off a year and a half ago, has been given a new lease of life. This day heralds not only its 100 per cent return to health, but also its move into the luxurious aviary and its meeting with human friends who care about it. Gracia, who had just entered her new home, was a little shy, but soon became active, wallowing in the basin and eating the grapes with her new beak. To remind people of the damage it has suffered, instead of painting its new beak, technicians have kept the original white of the 3D printing material. The beak is covered with a thin, horny sheath that is hollow inside, with only a few thin, bone-supporting poles interlaced. Despite this internal reinforcement, the toucan's beak is still fragile and will break when it is damaged. The Animal Rescue Center, ornithologists and an American 3D printing company worked together to create several ""experimental beaks"" for Gracia, finally creating the ""perfect beak"" for her. Gracia is now adept at using her new beak to drink, eat and even pick up tiny grains. ""The final product took about two months to design and only four or five hours to print."" ""3D printing is not the technology of the future, it has really come into your life and mine,"" Thomas Langer, chairman of SG3D printing company, told Xinhua International. Gracia, a toucan covered in blood, was discovered on a farm in Gracia, in the central Alajuela province of Costa Rica, in January 2015. At that time, its beak was brutally broken by a group of young people, it was completely unable to eat, life-threatening. The tragedy in Gracia has caused a flurry of calls against animal cruelty in and around Costa Rica after media reports. There have been calls for stricter animal protection laws and greater penalties for abusers. People came spontaneously and did their best to help Gracia get back to life as much as possible before the injury. Even Chuck Hull, the inventor of 3D printing technology, was involved in the design of Gracia's upper beak. ""The case of Gracia is unique in that the remaining part of its upper beak is less than one centimetre, which makes it difficult to install a new beak,"" he said. ""We scanned Gracia and then designed and made an extended prosthesis that was slightly longer than the rest of her upper beak. ""This will reduce further invasive damage to Gracia,"" Langer told Xinhua International. Before installing the prosthesis, staff had to clean up Gracia's beak every day to prevent infection. Thousands of miles away, the story of Toucan Gracia moved famous documentary filmmaker Paula Heredia and Discovery News producer John Hoffman. They chronicled the installation of Gracia's new beak and recorded a documentary, ""Land of the Toucans,"" which was shown on Animal Planet this month. The documentary ""Land of Toucans"" shows how a tiny toucan can make a country change for itself, and how it can involve its citizens in the fight against animal cruelty.",human_b,mt

Currently, at least 28 provinces in the country have clarified their subsidy disbursement criteria, but the disbursement criteria differs among provinces. In Chongqing, high-temperature subsidy is received based on subsidy for high-temperature working days. At temperatures equal or more than 35℃ and less than 37℃, each person shall be given a fee of not less than RMB10 per day. At temperatures higher than 37℃, each person shall be given a fee of not less than RMB15 per day. Workers working at above a temperature of 40℃ can receive a monthly subsidy of up to 20 RMB per day (this does not apply to a worker who is already provided with a high temperature operation subsidy according to law). According to this criteria, Kaizhou, which experienced the most number of high-temperature days last month would receive RMB330, while Chengkou which experienced the least number of days would received RMB80. As the highest temperature in Youyang did not exceed the high temperature benchmark, it did not receive any high-temperature subsidy. In the past, many companies often use cooling and refreshing beverages to offset the high temperature subsidy. The city administration of work safety, however, expressed that this act is not compliant to the current laws. Employers may not deduct or reduce the salary of laborers if work has to be suspended or work time reduced due to high temperatures. The municipal human resources and social security bureau said that workers who worked under high temperatures without receiving high temperature allowance may fight for their legal rights by way of the labor dispute mediation mechanism, or call 12333 to file a complaint. In case employer refuse to pay high-temperature allowance, employee is entitled to complain to the local administrative authority of HR and social security at the county level. Also, since the high temperature subsidy is considered part of the salary and not a benefit, it is included in total salary and subject to the personal income tax. High temperature subsidies are not included considered part of the minimum wage and must be issued in the form of cash. They cannot be replaced in the form of beverages or other tangible items.","According to statistics of the Chongqing Municipal Meteorological Bureau portal on the high-temperature weather in various districts and counties except Fuyang, the rest of the city may have a deviance on the high temperature. Currently, there are at least 28 provinces in China that have clearly defined the standards for the subsidy. However, the standards issued by provinces and cities are not the same. Chongqing, on one other hand, receives heat allowances in the form of heat allowances on weekdays. If the temperature is 35°C to 37°C , a rate of not less than 10 yuan per person per day; if it exceeds 37°C, the rate shall not be less than 15 yuan per person per day. Workers working in high temperature environment above 40°C can receive up to 20 yuan per day per month (except for laborers who already receive the heat allowance according to law). According to this standard, Kaizhou, had the most days of high-temperature weather last month, and was able to receive 330 yuan, and Chengkou had the least number of days which equated to 80 yuan. The highest temperature recorded in Puyang did not reach the high temperature standard, so there was no heat allowance. In the past, many would give cold drinks instead of heat allowances. The City Work Safety Administration stated that such practices are not in line with current regulations. The employer may not deduct or reduce the wages of workers due to the stoppage of work due to high temperature and reduce working hours. The Municipal Bureau of Human Resources and Social Affairs stated that when an employee faces a situation where a the work environment is considered high-temperature but does not receive a heat allowance, he or she can seek legal rights through the labor dispute mediation agency where the company is located, or call 12333 to file a complaint. Where a company refuses to issue a heat allowance, the laborer may complain to the appropriate department in human resources and social security at or above the county level where the employment is located. Also, because heat allowances are part of wages and not benefits, they must be included in total wages and deducted from taxes. Therefore, the heat allowance is not part of the minimum wage and must be paid in cash. It cannot be replaced with physical items such as drinks.",human_a,human_b

But they grow extremely slowly, sometimes only about 1cm a year, suggesting that Greenland sharks may have an extraordinarily long life. Traditional dating methods typically use calcified tissue from animals, and some sharks may use fins, but this calcified tissue is rare in Greenland sharks. The new study, led by Julius Nielsen of the University of Copenhagen in Denmark, turned to radiocarbon dating using the eye lens of the Greenland shark. The method has previously been used to determine the age of whales, but it is the first time it has been used to determine the age of fish such as sharks. Their analysis showed that the largest shark had an estimated lifespan of 392 years, with a margin of error of 120 years. This means that the shark is at least 272 years old and is likely to reach a maximum of 512 years old. In addition, female Greenland sharks reportedly do not reach sexual maturity until they are about 4 metres in length, which translates into an age of at least 156 years. As a result, the researchers wrote in their paper, the Greenland shark is the longest-living vertebrate known on Earth, surpassing the previous long-lived champion right whale (211 years old).","The Greenland shark, also known as the Mouth Shark, is commonly found in the North Atlantic waters around Greenland and Iceland.
