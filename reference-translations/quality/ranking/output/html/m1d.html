	<div class="translation" id="m1d-4">Although it hasn't been confirmed, numerous sources have said Apple's fall 2016 launch will take place in September, and the iPhone 7 is really coming. Apple didn't respond, but word has spread about the new iPhone's features and configuration, and even pictures of the iPhone 7's "real model" are available online. The next generation of iPhones is "eye-catching", hot, hot, rich and out of stock... If you want to buy the real thing for the first time, make sure you choose a good channel, say, Suning. This added to the frustration over the new phone, "It lengthens, but it doesn't project a hologram at all! This generation of iPhones sucks." The iPhone 7, like other iPhones, has been accompanied by countless secrets before it was born. Also, multiple sources have claimed that the new iPhone will eliminate the 3.5mm headphone jack and instead use a Bluetooth connection and charging jack, which would give Apple room to add a second speaker. Another piece of evidence to back up the news is that back in 2014 Apple allowed headphone makers to make headphone products that were connected through a charging interface. The news is either true or false, and the answer won't be revealed until Apple's autumn 2016 launch. But that doesn't detract from the industry's bullish outlook for the iPhone 7 - which many believe will most likely be Apple's last major upgrade to the iPhone family. Though the iPhone's market share has fallen, according to data released recently by market research firm IDC. Among them, Goldman Sachs maintained a "buy" rating on Apple's stock, while BMO analysts said the iPhone 7 would reap a historic sales performance. At the same time, Hock Tan, CEO of Broadcom, said it was likely that Apple would increase revenue by more than 20 percent in the future, thanks entirely to the launch of the iPhone 7. Seven percent of respondents said they planned to buy the iPhone 7, compared with just four percent two years ago. It is understood that 20 per cent of the current group of users who hold the iPhone 6 or 6Plus plan to buy the iPhone 7, which is a fairly high percentage. Second, there is expert analysis, most of the fruit powder like to replace their iPhone handsets from generation to generation. About 26 percent of all iPhone users have not changed their phone in two years, or nearly 120 million users have had their iPhone for two years, according to the report. Media captionTaiwan has been hit by several earthquakes during the production of the iPhone 7. "TSMC's production facilities have been damaged beyond imagination and could have an impact on the initial supply of the iPhone 7." Contradictions between supply and demand will affect ordinary users, it is time to choose a good channel, the first time low prices to start the genuine iPhone 7. According to people familiar with the matter, recently, Suning executives have been meeting with Apple frequently in order to prepare an adequate supply. The operator has already negotiated with Suning, and predictably, with the deep cooperation between the two sides, it is bound to bring lower prices and more intimate services to users. "At the lowest price, consumers might be able to buy an iPhone 7 for as little as $7 a day," he said. Sufficient supply and a variety of concessions, so that the purchase of the iPhone 7 is no longer "pressure mountain," and Suning's logistics, is to turn this beautiful into a more intuitive experience. Maybe you'll get a call in the middle of the night saying, "Hello, Suning EasyJet, your iPhone 7 is here."</div>
	<div class="translation" id="m1d-4">It has not yet been confirmed yet, but many sources have indicated that Apple's 2016 fall conference will be held in September. The iPhone 7 is really going to come out. Although Apple did not comment, information and specification of the new iPhone has been released and there are "actual" photos of the iPhone 7 on the web. The new generation of the iPhone is going to be slick, popular, and limited, thus if you want to be one of the first one to get a hold of it, be sure to know where to buy it from...like Suning. "This has led to further disappointment in the new phone. It is longer but can't even take videos. This generation of iPhone is terrible." Like the other iPhones, iPhone 7 had its share of secrets before being released. In addition, there are multiple sources claiming that the new generation of iPhone will not feature a 3.5mm headphone jack and use Bluetooth connectivity instead and will just have the charging port. This will provide space for Apple to add a second speaker. As evidence to backup this claim, Apple had developed earphones that would connect to the charging port back in 2014. Regardless of whether the rumors are true or not, we will only know for sure when it is announced in Apple's fall 2016 conference. However, this does not prevent the industry from looking at the potential specification of the iPhone 7 - many believe that the iPhone 7 will most likely be Apple's last major upgrade to the iPhone series. IDC, which is a market research institute recently released data that the market share of iPhone has declined. However, Goldman Sachs will maintain the "buy" rating for Apple's stock, and BMO analysts believe that iPhone7 will come together with a historic sales performance. Additionally, Broadcom’s CEO Hock Tan also stated that Apple’s future revenue growth may exceed 20%, all thanks to the launch of the iPhone 7. Seven percent of respondents said they had plans to purchase the iPhone 7, compared to only four percent who planned to purchase the iPhone 6 two years ago. It is understood that 20% of those currently using the iPhone 6 or 6 Plus plan to purchase the iPhone 7, which is a very high percentage. Also, experts analyzed that most of Apple consumers like to replace their iPhones every generation. According to the data, about 26% of all iPhone users have not changed their phones for 2 years. Which means almost 120 million people have used the iPhone for 2 years. Some media claimed that Taiwan faced several earthquakes during the production of iPhone 7 and, “The damage of TSMC's production facilities was bigger than expected and may affect the initial iPhone 7 supply.” The disparity between supply and demand will affect the average customers. It is time to choose a good place to buy an authentic iPhone 7 early at a lower price. According to informed sources, Suning executives met frequently with Apple in order to prepare enough stock. The company is already in discussion with Suning, and will inevitable provide a lower price and better service for consumers through a high-level of cooperation between the two parties. “At the lowest price, consumers may only need to pay 7 yuan a day to purchase the iPhone 7.” Plentiful stock and various services will make purchasing the iPhone less stressful. Through Suning's logistics, will further lead to a heightened buying experience. You may perhaps get a call in the middle of a night which will say "Hi this is Suning.com. Your iPhone 7 is here."</div>

	<div class="translation" id="m1d-8">The head of the Department of Industry Coordination of the National Development and Reform Commission pointed out today that overcapacity in the steel industry was a global issue. Production capacity utilization in our country is higher than that of the global average, and higher than those in the US and Europe. Our country has taken definite and effective measures to address excess production capacity, and preliminary results are gradually emerging. The person-in-charge pointed out that the State Council of the People's Republic of China has placed great importance upon the global issue of excessive steel and iron production capacity. All departments and regions shall actively implement the plans of State Council, and work conscientiously to reduce crude steel production capacity by about 45 million tonnes this year. From the perspective of domestic national conditions, China does not encourage steel exports. On the contrary, it has adopted a series of practical measures to control steel exports. The person in charge emphasized that the international trade of steel products is essentially market behavior. It is triggered by demand from importing nations, as well as the voluntary choice of consumers after taking into consideration a number of factors such as the products' price-performance ratio. The implementation of protectionist measures will not help to fundamentally resolve the development issues of the global steel industry. Instead, this would only result in a further attack on international trade order. When talking about the debt, the person-in-charge emphasized that the key for resolving the debt issue is to properly take care of excessive production capacity. As steel enterprises have massive assets, and cover a broad spectrum, the debt relationships of some of these enterprises are complicated. If handled inappropriately, regional risk could result. The person in charge described that recent increase in economic pressures have led to weakening of overall demands from the society. Production capacity utilization for a number of industries have decreased, increasing the difficulties for corporate production and operations. Some enterprises were unable to adapt to changes in the market environment. Business operations became unsustainable, and were even on the brink of collapse. Constrained by institutional mechanisms however, there were more hindrances to market-oriented exits, resulting in "zombie enterprises". The existence of such enterprises distorted market signals, lowered the utilization rate of factor resources, increased the cost of public administration, and hindered the building of a fair and competitive market environment. The major reason for the losses is similar to the difficulty confronting the global steel industry - market demand is sluggish and capacity utilization rates are low. Our nation mainly adopts a market mechanism, economic means and the rule of law. The government is primarily focused on carrying out various aspects of worker resettlement and social stability, ensuring fair and just market order. The person in charge emphasized that the next step forward would be to steadfastly continue to eliminate excess production capacity, and to ensure that the goal of removing 100 million to 150 million tonnes of crude steel capacity in five years would be achieved.</div>
	<div class="translation" id="m1d-8">Today, the head of the Industry Coordination Department of the National Development and Reform Commission pointed out that the excess capacity of steel is a global issue. In recent years, China's capacity utilization rate has been higher than the global average. It is also higher than the United States and Europe and in other countries. China has taken quick and effective measures to resolve the issue of overproduction, and is gradually coming into effect. The person in charge pointed out that the Central Committee and the State Council excess capacity of steel is a global issue. All departments and regions actively implemented the State Council's orders and actively carried them out. The crude steel production capacity this year should be reduced by around 45 million tons. From a national standpoint, China does not encourage the export of steel products. Instead, it adopts a series of practical measures to control the export of steel products. The person in charge emphasized that international trade of steel products is a market-driven decision made by the needs of the importing country based on the price and other factors. The implementation of trade protection measures will not fundamentally solve the problem of global steel industry development. On the contrary, it will only cause further issues to the international market. The person in charge also emphasized that resolving the deficit issue is important and needs to be resolved properly and concurrently with the issue of excess capacity. As the asset and scope of steel making companies are massive, the debt issue of some companies are complex and there will be a regional risk if it is not handled appropriately. According to the person in charge, in recent years, as the pressure of economic downturn has increased, the total social demand has gradually weakened, and the capacity utilization rate of some industries has declined. As a result, the production and operation of enterprises have become increasingly difficult. Some enterprises are unable adapt to the changes in the market, thus production and management are difficult to sustain and lead to bankruptcy. However, due to the constraints of some institutional mechanisms, there are many obstacles to market-based withdrawal which leads to companies becoming "zombie companies". The existence of such enterprises has distorted market signals, reduced resource utilization efficiency, increased social management costs, and hindered the establishment of a fair market environment. The main cause of losses is the same as the predicament faced by the global steel industry. Basically the market demand is weak and capacity utilization is low. Our country mainly adopts market mechanisms, economic instruments, and regulations. The government mainly does a good job for all employees and provide social stability to ensure a fair market. The person in charge emphasized that in the next step, we must diligently continue to do a good job in the production capacity and ensure that the target of reducing 100 to 150 million tons of crude steel production capacity is completed in five years.</div>

	<div class="translation" id="m1d-12">The Rio Olympic "Green Pool" incident has come under scrutiny in recent days as the water in the diving pool turned from blue to green, foreign media reported. However, water from the water polo match pool adjacent to the diving pool also turned green on the morning of Oct. The Australian water polo player said after the match that he felt a tingling in his eyes and wanted to shed tears. Earlier, Rio Olympic officials confirmed the pool turned green and said the discoloration was due to a weakening of the alkalinity and would not affect the athletes' physical health. But Australian athletes said after their victory against the Japanese team in the water polo pool that they had a tingling in their eyes. After the water in the diving pool turned green at the earliest, the competition organizers worked overtime on the night of 9 to deal with the problem, but on the morning of 10 found that the color of the water polo pool also changed rapidly. Environmental conditions in the water polo pools deteriorated during the Australian team's match against Japan, but officials stressed they would return the water quality in both pools to its original colour on Nov. "The water in the diving pool was the first to weaken in alkalinity yesterday afternoon," Rio Olympic spokesman Mario Andrada said. "We learned about a range of possible causes of pool water discoloration and the alkalinity of the water quality," he said. The water sports centre has carried out a series of tests and hundreds of divers and swimmers have used the pool to make sure the conditions are up to standard. "We've been following normal procedures these days, but we may have overlooked the impact more athletes could have on water quality," he said. "But a change in the colour of the water certainly has no effect on health, especially for athletes," he said.

	<div class="translation" id="m1d-12">According to foreign media reports, the Olympic Green Pool incident has received much attention recently due to the water of the diving pool changing from blue to green. On the morning of the 10th, the pool for water polo next to the diving pool also turned green. Australian Water Polo players said after the game that his eyes were stinging and was teary. The officials of the Rio Olympics confirmed earlier that the water in the pool turned green, and said that the discoloration of the pool water was due to weaker alkaline conditions and would not affect the physical health of the athletes. However, Australian athletes said after winning the match against the Japanese team in the water polo pool, they felt a tingling pain in their eyes. When the diving pool first turned green, the organizers worked overtime on the 9th to resolve the issue at the diving pool. However, in the early morning of the 10th, they discovered that the pool for water polo had suddenly turned green. The conditions of the water polo pool got worse during the match between Australia and Japan. Officials stressed that they will restore the water quality of the two pools to their original colors on the 11th. Mario Andrada, a spokesman for the Rio Olympic Games, said "The alkaline level of water in the diving pool weakened first yesterday afternoon." "We understand that one of the reasons that affect water quality and color is the alkalinity of water." The water sports center conducted a series of tests on water quality. Hundreds of divers and swimmers used the swimming pool to determine if the water quality condition meets the standards. ” "We have followed normal procedures in the last few days but we may have overlooked that the usage of the pool by more athletes could affect the water quality." "But we can say that the discoloration is not a health concern and will especially not affect the athletes." "This independent team confirmed our assessment and affirmed our measures to restore the pool to normal colors and normal chemical conditions." "We had hoped to restore the pool to its original color in the morning but the work was slowed down due to the rain."</div>

As a result, the problems of high pollution, large energy sources, and more land occupation have not been fundamentally addressed from the shift in production and life style. On the one hand, Jiangsu Province at all levels of the effectiveness of various types of ecological environment to create, with absolute superiority in the first place in the country; but on the other hand, the resources and environment bearing pressure.

The social circle of cyberspace has become more and more common. It has not only gradually replaced the traditional means of communication by phone, but is also affecting our social circles. It is quietly changing the social lives of people. The benefits of social networking online are obvious, such as the convenience, and especially cater to the young generation. A survey on college students’ social habits shows that 57% of college students spend more than five hours a day using mobile phones, and it has become inseparable with their daily lives. "The social network has the characteristics of inexpensive, fast, and being able to network with a large crowd, which is in line with the needs of college students today." Expanding the circle of interpersonal relationships, a more equal dialogue, and avoiding social concerns are the main reasons why we love chatting online more. New company staffs likes to communicate with their coworkers online. "As many are not familiar with it, they communicated without borders which built a good relationship among them." People who like to make friends also like to use this. "There was an instance where I had lost contact with someone due to a misunderstanding. However I was able to connect with that person again by conversing in groups." Wu Yan, an IT engineer, is an in-depth social networking enthusiast. Most of his social life happens online, where the number of people online is several times more than those offline. Wu Yan admits that being online is "like being a fish in the water". "You can reply your friends at your own pace. You will be able to express yourself better as you have time to think about what to write." "You can stay behind your online ID and avoid face-to-face conflict; will have the peace of mind to think things out before taking action." "Two different people can come together and communicate at the same level. Thus the social concerns in real life seem to be non-existent online." However, Wu’s friend Xiaopeng thinks that Wu’s life is enclosed and abnormal. Xiaopeng and Wu Yan met in a large group and as they were both active talkers, they quickly became good friends. Xiaopeng felt that Wu Yan and two other people online were bland and did not actively express their opinions. Their replies were often "Oh, ok, really," or "Let me check online."</div>

"People of different identities have the right and efficiency to speak the same way, and social concerns in real life seem to be dispelled in cyberspace." However, Wu Yan's friend Xiao Peng feels that Wu Yan in life is a "pretty boring house man." Xiao Peng and Wu Yan met in a large group because they were both active speakers and soon became familiar with each other. Xiao Peng feels that Wu Yan is different from the Internet, the language is boring, do not take the initiative to express their views, flipping over and over is a few words, "Oh, OK, is it", or "This I want to check on the Internet."</div>

	<div class="translation" id="m1d-19">Unfortunately, the latest monthly report of OPEC indicated continuous increase in crude oil production volume in July. Saudi Arabia even reached in a record height in terms of production volume. This report couldn't help but trigger market suspicion over OPEC's credibility. The path toward recovery in oil prices is still difficult. On Monday, Qatar's Energy Minister Mohammed Bin Saleh Al-Sada who holds OPEC's rotating presidency said that OPEC will hold an unofficial meeting during the International Energy Foundation conference which will be held between September 26 and 28. OPEC's monthly report published on Wednesday showed that OPEC's total output (including Gabon) in July rose by 46,000 barrels/day to 33.11 million barrels/day. OPEC expressed in its monthly report that the low price of crude oil has encouraged more refineries around the world to produce more refined oil products, worsening the issue of excessive supply in the market. This news, coupled with the US raising its crude oil production forecast and unexpected increase in crude oil stockpiles has caused global oil prices to fall for two consecutive days. The price of light crude oil futures for delivery in September closed 2.48% lower on the New York Mercantile Exchange as of Wednesday, while the price of Brent crude oil futures for delivery in October fell 2.07%. Reuters believe that the proposed conference of the petroleum producing countries is unlikely to order significant reduction in production. Data published by the US Energy Information Administration also cooled the market. Fars, the official media company of Iran, quoted Iranian Minister of Petroleum Zanganeh who said that the maximum crude oil production of Iran will be 3.85 million barrels per day, the highest volume since 2008. Once information for the meeting has been released, Novak, the Russian Minister of Energy, expressed that under current oil prices, there is no need to initiate a new round of negotiations regarding frozen assets. The last time oil producing naitons convened a meeting was in April. OPEC members failed to reach an agreement on any measure. BMI Research Oil and Gas Analyst Emma Richards said that the market and the media may have over-reacted to the meeting OPEC is about to convene. Helima Croft, Top Commodities Strategist of Royal Bank of Canada, expressed that OPEC has released signals that they would be reaching an agreement to transform the mood of the market. This method was like smoke and mirrors to divert people's attention (deliberately giving people the wrong impression). Eugen Weinberg, Head of Commodity Research at Commerzbank AG, said that people believe that there is a low possibility for OPEC to use the September meeting to stabilize the market. This might further disrupt market confidence for OPEC as this organization has "cried wolf" before.</div>

	<div class="translation" id="m1d-22">Gracia is a cute female toucan with the scent of the jungle about her. In the Central American country of Costa Rica, the toucan Gracia and its story are extremely well-known. The August 10 press conference finally revealed Gracia after recovering from the operation, displaying its brand new 3D-printed plastic beak. This toucan whose upper beak was broken by someone, and which was on the brink of death, has now finally received a new lease of life. This is the day that the bird has reached 100% recovery and the day when it could be moved to a luxurious bird house and meet its human friends who have been caring for it. Gracia appears to be rather shy after moving to her new home, but quickly revealed her lively side, playing in the pool of water and using her new beak to eat grapes. To remind people of the abuse it once suffered, the technicians did not color its new beak, but kept it white, the original color of the 3D printing material. The external layer of the beak is a thin keratin sheath. The beak is hollow and only reinforced by thin, criss-crossing supporting struts of bone. Although reinforced internally, the toucan's beak is still fragile, and will crack when it is harmed. The animal aid center, an ornithologist, and a 3D printing company from the United States are working together, making several "experimental beaks" for Gracia before creating the "perfect beak" that best suits the bird. Now Gracia has become proficient in using her beak to drink, eat, and even pick up fine seed grains. "The design of the final product took about two months; printing took just four to five hours." "3D printing is not for next generation. It has become part of our life." Thomas Lange, President of SG3D told the  Xinhua News Agency. On January 2015, Gracia the toucan was found, bleeding from its mouth, by a person in a farm at Gracia, Alajuela Province in central Costa Rica. At the time, its upper beak was cruelly broken by a group of youths. It could not eat and was dying. Once reported in mass media, Gracia's sad state initiated a wave of outcry against animal abuse in and outside Costa Rica. The public requested more rigorous animal protection laws to be established, and punishment for abusers to be stepped out. People came forward voluntarily, and did the best they could to help Grecia regain its life prior to the injury. Even Chuck Hull, the inventor of 3D printing technology, also contributed towards the design of Gracia's upper beak. "Gracia's condition is quite unique. Less than 1 cm of its upper beak has remained, making it difficult to install a new beak." "We first scanned Gracia and then designed and manufactured an extended prosthetic that is slightly longer than its remaining upper beak. The prosthetic is then glued to its upper beak." "This will help reduce further invasive injury on Grecia," Lange told a XInhua international news reporter. Prior to installing the prosthetics, workers cleaned the broken beak for Gracia everyday to prevent infections. Thousands of miles away, the story of Gracia the toucan has moved renowned documentary filmmaker Paula Heredia and investigative journalist John Hoffman. Toucan Nation is a documentary that recorded in detail the process of fitting a new beak for Grecia, which was broadcast on Animal Planet this month. The documentary Toucan Nation showed how a small toucan bird could change a country and encourage every citizen to participate in the movement against animal abuse.</div>
	<div class="translation" id="m1d-22">Grecia is an adorable female toucan that exudes a tropical feel. The story of Grecia the toucan has been known early on in the Central American country of Costa Rica. In the press release on August 30th, Grecia who recovered from the surgery showed off her new prosthetic 3D printed beak to the public. The toucan whose beak was hacked off by humans and was dying a year and half ago is now reborn. This day not only confirms that she is 100% healthy, but also is a day when she will be relocated to a luxurious cage and a day for those who care about her to be able to see her. Grecia was a bit shy after moving to her new home but became more lively as she played in the water and ate grapes with her new beak. The engineering specialist did not newly paint the 3D printed beak to serve as a reminder to people of what she went through, thus leaving it in the original white color of the 3D printing material. The outer layer of the beak features a thin wall of keratin, and the inside is generally hollow and is only supported by several thin bone struts. Despite the interior being reinforced, the toucan's beak is still frail and can break when damaged. With the collaboration with the animal rescue center, bird specialists, and a US 3D printing company, the group was able to create several "trial versions" to identify and finally create "the perfect one". Grecia can now skillfully use her new beak to drink water, eat, and even pick up small grains. "The design of the final product took around 2 months and the printing only took 4-5 hours." The president of SG3D Printing, Thomas Lange explained to Xinhua International during an interview that, "3D printing is not a technology of the future but has already stepped in to our lives". In January 2015, a bloodied toucan (Grecia) was found on a farm in Grecia, Alajuela Province located in central Costa Rica. The beak was brutally hacked off by a group of youngsters. She could not eat at all and was in critical condition. After the media covered the story of Grecia's tragic situation, it triggered a wave of opposition on animal cruelty in and outside of Costa Rica. People have since called out for a stricter animal protection law and for harsher penalties for animal abuse. People proactively came together to do their best to help Grecia recover and regain her life before being injured. Chuck Hall who is the inventor of 3D printing was also involved in the design of Grecia's beak. "Grecia's situation was a very special one as there was less than 1 cm of the upper jaw left, which caused many difficulties in attaching the beak." "We first scanned Grecia then designed an extended cap that was a bit longer than the remnant beak, then glued the prosthetic beak". Lange told the reporters of Xinhua International that "By doing so, we can prevent further injury for Grecia". Before installing the prosthetic beak, the staff had to keep Grecia clean everyday to prevent infections. The story of Grecia the toucan travelled the distance and touched John Hoffman who is a producer at Discovery News Channel and Paul Heredia who is a famous documentary director. They filmed bits and pieces of the installation of Grecia's new beak to make a documentary called "Toucan Nation" which was aired on Animal Planet this month. The documentary "Toucan Nation" shows how a small Toucan inspired a nation to make changes and citizens to get involved to stop animal cruelty.</div>

Huang Yilin is a student from Central South University of Forestry and Technology for the class of 2015. Huang Yilin, who was studying urban and rural planning, wanted to visit Sichuan Zhongzhong to learn about the local architectural design, thus travelled together with her family. At around 10:00 on August 8, Huang Yilin’s father was resting at the hotel, while Huang Yilin and her mom went out to walk around Langzhong Ancient City. Without venturing too far, they saw a group of people yelling and screaming thus went up to see what the commotion was about. She saw that "the boy was already out of sight and the girl was desperately trying to stay above water with only half her head visible as her head bobbled up and down in the river". Huang Yilin had learned how to swim when she was young and jumped in quickly to save the child. After diving in, Huang Yilin realized that despite being 165 cm tall, her feet could not touch the bottom of the river!  Although the surface of the river seemed calm, the current was strong underneath!  But she was still determined to swim toward the girl. Huang Yilin said that the river was muddy and turbulent and she had to use almost all her strength to reach the girl who was less than 5 meters away. She tried her best to push the little girl to the edge of the river bank. "The slope was very slippery and I was afraid that I would use up my energy and sink." Huang Yilin called out to her mom for help. Her mom heard her cry for help and was about to go in the water and help. However as her mom was not in proper attire, she was stopped by a tourist beside her. On August 10th, after Huang Yilin jumped in the river to save the child, her mom was bombarded with comments, compliments, and "questions" from friends and relatives. "If you look back at it now, it was really scary! To be honest, when she could barely hold on to the riverbank and called to me for help, my heart almost shattered." Ms. Yin said that despite being dangerous, she would still support her daughter's decision if something like this happened again. She was very proud of her daughter!  Because Huang Yilin was forced to learn swimming, she never really swam after learning how to swim but "never thought it would come in handy in such a situation." According to the introduction of Huang Yilin's class leader Chen Yi-yang, Huang Yi-lin is recognized as an "honor student" and likes to help others.</div>

Seeing the "little boy has disappeared, the little girl in the water desperately flutter, the river only revealed her little head, from time to time to sink," a child learned to swim Huang Yilin hurriedly jumped down to save people. After entering the water, the 165cm Huang Yilin found that she could not walk to the end of the road!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Seemingly calm before the surface of the water, but underneath the torrent! But she was still desperate to swim to the little girl. Huang said the river was muddy and fast-flowing, less than five meters away and it took almost all her strength. She pushed the little girl as hard as she could to the bank of the river. "The slope was so slippery that I was afraid I wouldn't have the strength to go down." So Huang Yilin asked for help from her mother, heard her daughter's cry for help, and Ms. Yin, who was not in good water, prepared to go into the water to rescue her, and was stopped by the tourists next to her. August 10, Huang Yilin jumped into the river to save people after the news spread, Ms. Yin received a lot of friends and family condolences, praise, but also by many friends and family "accountability." "In retrospect it was really scary! To tell you the truth, my heart broke when the child could hardly hold out on the riverbank and asked for my help." Ms. Yin said with fright that even though it was dangerous, she would still support her daughter's choice if she was in a scene like that again, and she was proud of her daughter! Being forced, Huang rarely volunteered to go back into the water after learning to swim, "not expecting the skill to really come in handy." According to Huang Yilin's class monitor Chen Yilin, Huang Yilin is recognized as a "school bully" in the class, and is willing to help others.</div>

Those with dry skin should use sunscreen cream and those with neutral skin are not bound with any rules. Any type of skin care products is not good for those with sensitive skin and a 100% pure sunscreen is recommended. It takes time for the sunscreen to seep in thus do not forget to apply the sunscreen 30 minutes beforehand.

Twelve workers and one technician are enough for the 150mu groove with 10 varieties. Last year, the total amount of money was fifty thousand. At my age, I definitely couldn't make this amount of money if I were to work at a factory. Last year, village-level revenue of Donglin Village reached 22.00 million, of which agricultural income accounted for nearly half of this figure. Village Secretary Su Qifang: arable land area per capita is rising each year. It was 50 mu initially, and more than 100 mu now; average efficiency per mu is also rising annually. There is also room for the income of professional farmers to grow each year as well. Shares have been quantified and distributed to every villager. The biggest highlight of the Sunan Rural Collective Economy Reform is clearly stipulating the ownership of business operation assets of the rural collective and investigating the separation of politics and economy. The 14 Rural Economic Cooperatives（REC) in Anzhen Neighborhood, Xishan Dis., Wuxi and their corresponding village committees adopted the " account-divided management" from July, 2015. The committees were responsible for public affair, while the cooperatives for operation. The two institutions will keep separate accounting books to avoid "overlaps". This will prevent village officials from engaging in corrupt practices when  managing collective assets. According to Zhu Baoping, deputy director of the Jiangsu Agriculture Committee, the next step for Jiangsu is to continue to promote reforms pertaining to the community joint stock cooperative system, encourage joint development among farmers, and establish a village-level operating mechanism for democratic rights. Zhu Baoping: Expand the scope of reforms, implement community shareholding and partnerships, ensure that assets are distributed to community members, ensure fixed shareholding benefits to the farmers, and establish a clear ownership over the industry. By way of Internet+, his right to know, right to participate in decision-making, and right to supervise democratic administration are put into practice. The implementation of these three rights for farmers has indeed made it a standard joint stock cooperative operating mechanism.

The vice chairman of the Kuomintang, Steve Chan, said "The KMT with a history of more than one hundred years has social commitments and responsibilities and will not be defeated just like this." Lin Chuan emphasized that if a party, accompanying organization or trustee violates the provisions of the prohibition imposed by the regulations, the committee will investigate the case in accordance "with the law" and impose sanctions. Lin Chuan also announced that in regards to the selection of the vice chairman for the Ill-gotten Party Assets Settlemen Committee, "the Deputy Commissioner of the Independent Commission Against Corruption", Hong Peigen will be a candidate. He said that Wellington Koo was appointed as the chairman of the Ill-gotten Party Assets Settlemen Committee. Hong's experience in handling major cases in the past will serve as the basis for the committee to investigate relevant cases for the Ill-gotten Party Assets Settlemen Committee. Zhan Qixian believes that as long as there are still party campaigns, no one will give you public donations. If the party’s campaigns were all confiscated, the Kuomintang can just request public support and sponsorship. "You will only have the chance to go ask only when there is truly nothing left today". Zhan Qixian also emphasized that even if the Party’s campaign regulations were not properly implemented, the KMT’s campaign would  be completely taken away and confiscated, and the rest would be donated according to promises to allow the Party’s campaign to start from zero and work up from there.</div>

These regions have added the convenience of allowing children who meet relevant terms and conditions to take part in college entrance exams. Moreover, Beijing and many other cities decided to expand public services progressively with regular public announcement. For instance, as proposed by Fujian, an announcement should be made to the public at least once every three years as regards the scope of public services and conveniences enjoyed by persons holding residence permits.

	<div class="translation" id="m1d-47">According to the Chongqing Meteorological Bureau portal to the high temperature of the counties statistics, in addition to Youyang, the rest of the city can receive different degrees of high temperature allowance. At least 28 provinces across the country have now clarified the criteria for the payment of allowances, although the criteria are not the same in the provinces and municipalities, while Chongqing receives a high-temperature allowance in the form of a high-temperature working day allowance. If the temperature is above 35 ° C and below 37 ° C, the standard is not less than 10 yuan per person per day, and if the temperature is above 37 ° C, the standard is not less than 15 yuan per person per day. High temperature workers above 40 ℃ are entitled to a monthly allowance of up to 20 yuan / day (except for those workers who have already enjoyed the post allowance for high temperature operation in accordance with the law). According to this standard, last month, the highest number of days of hot weather in Kaizhou can receive 330 yuan, the number of days the least Chengkou is 80 yuan, and Youyang the highest temperature due to not meet the high temperature standards, so there is no high temperature allowance. In the past, many units would offset the high temperature allowance with refreshing drinks. The City Safety Supervision Bureau said that this practice was not in line with the current practice. The employing units shall not deduct or reduce the wages of the workers if they stop working or shorten their working hours due to the hot weather. The city's social service bureau said employees who have not received a high temperature allowance for working in high temperatures can fight for their legitimate rights and interests through the labor dispute mediation agency where the business is located, or call 12333 to lodge a complaint. If an employing unit refuses to pay a high-temperature allowance, the worker may file a complaint with the department in charge of human resources and social security at or above the county level in the place where the employee is employed. At the same time, since the high temperature allowance is part of the salary and not a benefit, it is included in the total salary and deducted from the tax. The high temperature allowance is therefore not covered by the minimum wage and must be paid in cash and cannot be substituted in kind, such as beverages.</div>
	<div class="translation" id="m1d-47">According to statistics of the Chongqing Municipal Meteorological Bureau portal on the high-temperature weather in various districts and counties except Fuyang, the rest of the city may have a deviance on the high temperature. Currently, there are at least 28 provinces in China that have clearly defined the standards for the subsidy. However, the standards issued by provinces and cities are not the same. Chongqing, on one other hand, receives heat allowances in the form of heat allowances on weekdays. If the temperature is 35°C to 37°C , a rate of not less than 10 yuan per person per day; if it exceeds 37°C, the rate shall not be less than 15 yuan per person per day. Workers working in high temperature environment above 40°C can receive up to 20 yuan per day per month (except for laborers who already receive the heat allowance according to law). According to this standard, Kaizhou, had the most days of high-temperature weather last month, and was able to receive 330 yuan, and Chengkou had the least number of days which equated to 80 yuan. The highest temperature recorded in Puyang did not reach the high temperature standard, so there was no heat allowance. In the past, many would give cold drinks instead of heat allowances. The City Work Safety Administration stated that such practices are not in line with current regulations. The employer may not deduct or reduce the wages of workers due to the stoppage of work due to high temperature and reduce working hours. The Municipal Bureau of Human Resources and Social Affairs stated that when an employee faces a situation where a the work environment is considered high-temperature but does not receive a heat allowance, he or she can seek legal rights through the labor dispute mediation agency where the company is located, or call 12333 to file a complaint. Where a company refuses to issue a heat allowance, the laborer may complain to the appropriate department in human resources and social security at or above the county level where the employment is located. Also, because heat allowances are part of wages and not benefits, they must be included in total wages and deducted from taxes. Therefore, the heat allowance is not part of the minimum wage and must be paid in cash. It cannot be replaced with physical items such as drinks.</div>

	<div class="translation" id="m1d-48">Toll collection started on September 1 for the Laowanfu River and Beidaliu navigation channels after their upgrades and reconstruction. These navigation channels are part of the Grand Canal.  The costs for the upgrades and reconstruction for these two will be covered with social financing, and the costs have been approved by the appropriate departments of the provincial government.  The Laowanfu River passes through Jinxiang and Yutai before linking with the Grand Canal through Nanyang Lake. Laowanfu River is a total of 32.5 kilometers. According to navigation requirements, the Laowanfu River waterway will need to adopt a proper maintenance method, deepen the water level, and straighten the channel, to improve the navigation conditions.  The waterway that goes through Jinxiang County and Rencheng District which then enters the main navigation channel of the Grand Canal via Nanyang Lake is 19 kilometers long. The work on the two channels started in February 2011 and was completed in January 2015. The principal for the investment and construction was by the Jining City Anping Canal Logistics Service Center. Based on the “paying off loans with a service fee” principle, the Anping Canal Logistics Service Center of Jining City will collect toll fees subject to the standards approved by the Shandong Provincial Price Bureau. One of such standard is the base toll calculated at 1.75 yuan/dwt, and a toll mileage of 0.05 yuan/km dwt. The toll collection period is from June 15, 2016 to June 14th, 2019. Reporters learned from the Jining City Port and Navigation Bureau that there are currently 4 tolled waterway in Jining consisting of Weishui River, Baima River, Beidake River, and Laowanfu River. The 4 waterways are tributaries of the Grand Canal and were upgraded via social financing. The Weishui River upgrade project was the first to feature the collaborative "Government + Market" model for waterway improvement in the Shangdong Province. The Government funded most of it while social funding was used to cover the balance. Baima River, Laowanfu River and Beidake River projects were done purely for the interest of the market. The budget allocated from the state finance is not enough to cover the cost of the project construction, and would impede on the upgrade progress of the channels. The use of social funding for the construction of public infrastructure meets the requirements of national policies and has also become a way to overcome funding issues.</div>

Based on navigational requirements, the Laowanfu River channel has adopted a method of maintenance and reconstruction, having partially dredged the riverbed to increase its depth, and partially straightening sharp bends in the river, among others. Conditions of the shipping channel have improved. This navigation channel has a total length of 19 km, flowing through Jinxiang County, Rencheng District, and entering, via Nanyang Lake, the Grand Canal. Constructions to renovate the two navigational channels began in February 2011, and were completed in January 2015 for inspections. The Jining City Anping Canal Logistic Service Center is the primary investor and operator of the channels. According to the " Build by loan, Charge to repay" principle, Anping Canal Logistic Service Center will charge the passage toll according to the rated approved by Shandong Price Bureau. Of which, a basic transportation fee is charged at 1.75 RMB/ton carried. Mileage transportation fee is charged at 0.05 RMB/km for each ton carried. Toll collection hours will begin on June 15, 2016 and end on June 14, 2019. From the Jining Maritime and Port Bureau, the reporter learned that there are 4 paid navigation channels within Jining, namely Zhushui River, Baima River, Beidaliu, and Laowanfu River navigation channels. The four shipping lanes are tributary channels of the Beijing-Hangzhou Grand Canal, and were upgraded and reconstructed by way of public financing. The project for upgrading and reconstructing the Zhushui River navigation channel is a first time attempt to use a "government + market" model. The project is an infrastructure undertaking for river ports in Shandong Province, with the government being the main investor while social investments make up for the gap in funding required. Baima River, Laowanfu River, Beidaliu River and other tributary navigational channels have adopted a pure market-based operating approach. The funds provided by the national budget could not satisfy construction costs, limiting the progress for navigation route upgrades. Social capital used for constructing public infrastructure is compliant to national policy requirements, and has become a means to resolve the capital bottleneck.</div>

She said she hid the diamonds in her underwear, carried them to the toilet and shower for days on end, and was nervous about walking and sleeping. She claims that diamonds bought in Antwerp cost about $55,000 per carat, while diamonds of the same quality retail at about $111,000 in Xiamen. A few days ago, she sold all the diamonds on her behalf at a 20% mark-up, making a profit of $200,000 at a time. According to the Mainland Customs, diamonds are not articles or necessities for passengers in their itinerary and therefore fall into the category of goods.

	<div class="translation" id="m1d-56">The Greenland Shark is also known as the small-headed sleeper shark, and is widely distributed in the Northern Atlantic around Greenland and Iceland. When fully-grown, the shark can reach a length of 4 to 5 meters. The Greenland shark grows at a extremely slow rate, only 1 cm per year sometimes, suggesting a particularly long lifespan. Traditional dating methods often use calcified tissues of animals. Fin spines may used in some sharks but this type of calcified tissue is extremely rare in Greenland sharks. New research led by Julius Nielsen of Denmark's University of Copenhagen used the lens of the eyes of the Greenland shark to carry out radiocarbon dating. This method has been used before to determine the age of a whale, but is used, for the first time, to determine the age of a shark and similar types of fish. Their analysis indicated that the largest shark has an age of about 392 years, with a standard error of about 120 years. This means that this shark is at least 272 years old, and could be as old as 512 years old. A female Greenland Shark must reach a length of about 4 meters to reach reproductive maturity. When converted to actual age, she must be at least 156 years old before she is mature. Researchers therefore included, within their paper, that the Greenland Shark is the currently-known longest-living vertebrate animal on Earth, surpassing the previous champion of right whales with a lifespan of 211 years.</div>
	<div class="translation" id="m1d-56">The Greenland shark, also known as the Mouth Shark, is commonly found in the North Atlantic waters around Greenland and Iceland. They grow to 4-5 meters in length as an adult. However, they grow very slow, sometimes only about 1 cm in 1 year. This suggests that the Greenland shark may have an exceptionally long life span. Using calcified tissue to measure age is the traditional method and fins can be used with some sharks. However the calcified tissue is very rare in Greenland sharks. A new study led by Julius Nilsson of the University of Copenhagen in Denmark looked at radiocarbon dating of the eye lens of the Greenland Shark. This method was previously used to determine the age of the whales, but this the first time that this was applied to determine the age of sharks. Their study shows that the life of the largest shark is estimated to be 392 years old and with a deviation of 120 years old. This means that the oldest shark is at least 272 years old and could be as old as 512 years old. In addition, the female Greenland shark is said to be ready to mate when it is about 4 meters in length, which equates to an age of at least 156 before reaching adulthood. Therefore, the researchers wrote in the paper that the Greenland shark is the longest-lived vertebrate known on the earth and surpasses the right whale (211 years old) which previously held that title.</div>
