	<div class="translation" id="b2d-4">Once a new life is born to this world, the parents shall bear the responsibility for this life. This responsibility is not only the physical well-being, but also mental development which is education. If you succeed in your business but disregard your child's education, it will not be enough to makeup for the failure of your life and family. When a child is born, new fathers and mothers needs to be responsible and spend time to look after and educate the child. Responsibility of a child not only covers the physical well-being but also to educate them and help them develop mentally. Basically, let the child learn how to behave, grow up, and succeed. A good family environment is one where parents will always be with the child, and take care of the child whole-heartedly. Parents also needs to teach their child how to learn and become civilized. A parent's words and actions can affect how the child grows up. As a child would imitate parent's actions, there is a Chinese saying that a dragon will come from a dragon, a phoenix will come from a phoenix, and the child of a mouse will make holes, which basically means the whatever the parents do, the child will do the same. Therefore, parents have to a good role-model for their child. Parent's should strive to improve themselves and be careful of what you say and do as they can all cultivate a child's good character and become a better person.</div>
	<div class="translation" id="b2d-4">After a baby is born, parents must assume responsibility for this life. This responsibility does not merely concern the physical health of the child but also mental development, i.e. education. Failing in children's education is a loss in life and family that cannot be compensated by success in career-building. When a life is born, the new parents must spend time and effort to take care and educate the child, and be responsible to it. To become responsible, in addition to caring for the body, providing them with a healthy and spiritual education, the children are taught how to socialize properly, become responsible adults, and gain success. Good family education means that parents must spend time with their children often and provide them with love, patient care, and teach them how to develop well-mannered speech and behavior, allowing children to achieve better learning and improvements to their mental skills. Every saying and act of parents will influence the development of their child. The child will often mimic their parents, just like the traditional saying that goes: "A dragon gives birth to a dragon, a phoenix gives rise to a phoenix. A rat's child will eventually learn to dig holes." The child will take after its parents. Parents must provide a good role model in front of their children, control their words and saying, and develop an excellent character of their own. All this can indirectly help build a positive personality in children and make them more successful.</div>

	<div class="translation" id="b2d-5">On August 11th, when a reporter returned a call to Huang Yilin in Mianyang, Sichuan, she said “The situation was too dire at the time and the only thought I had in my mind was to save people!”. Huang Yilin is a student from Central South University of Forestry and Technology for the class of 2015. Huang Yilin, who was studying urban and rural planning, wanted to visit Sichuan Zhongzhong to learn about the local architectural design, thus travelled together with her family. At around 10:00 on August 8, Huang Yilin’s father was resting at the hotel, while Huang Yilin and her mom went out to walk around Langzhong Ancient City. Without venturing too far, they saw a group of people yelling and screaming thus went up to see what the commotion was about. She saw that "the boy was already out of sight and the girl was desperately trying to stay above water with only half her head visible as her head bobbled up and down in the river". Huang Yilin had learned how to swim when she was young and jumped in quickly to save the child. After diving in, Huang Yilin realized that despite being 165 cm tall, her feet could not touch the bottom of the river!  Although the surface of the river seemed calm, the current was strong underneath!  But she was still determined to swim toward the girl. Huang Yilin said that the river was muddy and turbulent and she had to use almost all her strength to reach the girl who was less than 5 meters away. She tried her best to push the little girl to the edge of the river bank. "The slope was very slippery and I was afraid that I would use up my energy and sink." Huang Yilin called out to her mom for help. Her mom heard her cry for help and was about to go in the water and help. However as her mom was not in proper attire, she was stopped by a tourist beside her. On August 10th, after Huang Yilin jumped in the river to save the child, her mom was bombarded with comments, compliments, and "questions" from friends and relatives. "If you look back at it now, it was really scary! To be honest, when she could barely hold on to the riverbank and called to me for help, my heart almost shattered." Ms. Yin said that despite being dangerous, she would still support her daughter's decision if something like this happened again. She was very proud of her daughter!  Because Huang Yilin was forced to learn swimming, she never really swam after learning how to swim but "never thought it would come in handy in such a situation." According to the introduction of Huang Yilin's class leader Chen Yi-yang, Huang Yi-lin is recognized as an "honor student" and likes to help others.</div>
	<div class="translation" id="b2d-5">On August 11, when the reporter's telephone interview reached Huang Yilin who has returned to her home at Jinyang in Sichuan, she said: "It was an emergency. The only thing I could think of is to rescue people." Huang Yiling is a student of the 2015 cohort of the Landscape Architecture School in the Central South University Forestry and Technology. Huang Yilin who is now studying the professional field of town and country planning wishes to visit Langzhong in Sichuan to learn about architecture in that region, and thus took the entire family to a trip to that location. At about 10 am on August 8, Huang Yilin's father was resting at the hotel, while she and her mother were getting ready to wander about Langzhong Ancient City. After walking for a short distance, they saw a small crowd screaming and yelling, and approached them out of curiosity. Seeing that the "little boy has disappeared and that the little girl is splashing around in the water, with her head bobbing up and down the river water as the water keeps dragging her down", Huang Yilin, who had learned swimming at a young age, jumped into the water to save the child. After jumping into the river, 165-meter tall Huang Yilin realized she could not find the bottom! The water surface which seemed serene previously hid powerful currents underneath. But she did everything she could to swim toward the little girl. Huang Yilin said that the river was muddy and rapid. She was almost spent swimming a distance of less than 5 meters. She used her entire strength to push the little girl to the side of the levee. "The slope is so slipper. I thought I might sink when I run out of power." Huang Yilin therefore cried out to her mother for help. Upon hearing her daughter's cries, Mdm Yin, who was not a good swimmer, decided to go into the water but was stopped by other swimmers. On August 10, after the story of Huang Yilin leaping into the river to save a girl spread, Mdm Yin received plenty of words of comfort and praise from family members and friends, as well as "blame" from many. " I still feel the linger fear! To tell you the truth, my heart was broken when the kid almost fading on the bank cried out for help. Fear still lingered in Mdm Yin's heart. Despite the dangers, Mdm Yin said that she would still support the choice made by her daughter under such circumstances and felt proud for what she did. Huang Yilin seldom took the initiative to go swimming after she learned the skill because she was forced into it. "Who would have thought it would come in handy." According to Huang Yilin's class monitor Chen Yiyang, the class has long regarded Huang Yilin as the "top-scoring student" and knew that she is willing to help others.</div>

These navigation channels are part of the Grand Canal.  The costs for the upgrades and reconstruction for these two will be covered with social financing, and the costs have been approved by the appropriate departments of the provincial government.  The Laowanfu River passes through Jinxiang and Yutai before linking with the Grand Canal through Nanyang Lake. Laowanfu River is a total of 32.5 kilometers.

The Government funded most of it while social funding was used to cover the balance. Baima River, Laowanfu River and Beidake River projects were done purely for the interest of the market. The budget allocated from the state finance is not enough to cover the cost of the project construction, and would impede on the upgrade progress of the channels.

	<div class="source" id="b2d-18">尽管还没有被证实，但诸多消息源都表示，苹果2016年秋季发布会将在9月举行，iPhone7真要来了。 虽然苹果公司并未回应，但有关新iPhone的功能、配置已经陆续有消息放出，甚至网上连iPhone7“真机模型”图片都有了。 新一代iPhone可谓“万众瞩目”，火热、紧俏、有钱无货……如果你想第一时间购买到正品，一定要选择一个好渠道，比如说，苏宁。 这加剧了人们对于新手机的失望，“它加长了，却根本不能投射全息图像!这一代iPhone糟透了。” iPhone7像其他iPhone一样，出生之前就伴随着无数秘闻。 另外，还有多个消息源声称，新一代iPhone将取消3.5mm耳机接口，转而使用蓝牙连接和充电接口，这将为苹果增加第二个扬声器提供空间。 能佐证这一消息的另一证据是，早在2014年苹果就允许耳机厂商生产通过充电接口连接的耳机产品。 这些消息或真或假，答案直到苹果2016秋季发布会才能揭晓。 但这并不妨碍业内人士看好iPhone7的前景——许多人认为，iPhone7将很有可能成为苹果对iPhone系列的最后一次大幅升级。 虽然从不久前市场研究机构IDC公布的数据来看，iPhone的市场份额有所下滑。 其中，高盛将苹果的股票维持“买入”评级，而BMO的分析师则认为iPhone7将收获一份历史性的销售成绩。 同时博通公司的CEO Hock Tan也表示，苹果未来的营收增加将有可能超过20%，而这完全得益于iPhone7的推出。 有7%的受访者表示他们有购买iPhone7的打算，而两年前计划购买iPhone6的人数比例只有4%。 据了解，目前持有iPhone6或6Plus的用户群体有20%计划购买iPhone7，这是一个相当高的比例。 其次，有专家分析，大部分果粉都喜欢隔代更换自己的iPhone手机。 据统计，在所有的iPhone用户中，有大约26%的用户已经2年没有更换手机了，也就是差不多有1.2亿的用户的iPhone已经用了2年。 有媒体称，iPhone7生产期间，台湾遭遇数次地震，“台积电生产设施的受破坏程度超出想象，并有可能对初期的iPhone7供应产生影响。” 供需矛盾会影响普通用户，是时候选择一个好渠道，第一时间低价入手正品iPhone7。 据知情人士透露，近期，苏宁高层与苹果公司频频见面，目的就是为了准备充足的货源。 运营商已经与苏宁谈妥，可以预见的是，随着双方的深度合作，必然会为用户带来更低的价格和更贴心的服务。 “最低的价格，消费者可能‘一天只需7元钱，就能购买iPhone7’。” 充足的货源与多样的优惠，让购买iPhone7不再“压力山大”，而苏宁的物流，更是会把这种美好变成更直观的体验感。 也许，你半夜就会接到电话，“您好，苏宁易购，您的iPhone7到了。”</div>
	<div class="translation" id="b2d-18">It has not yet been confirmed yet, but many sources have indicated that Apple's 2016 fall conference will be held in September. The iPhone 7 is really going to come out. Although Apple did not comment, information and specification of the new iPhone has been released and there are "actual" photos of the iPhone 7 on the web. The new generation of the iPhone is going to be slick, popular, and limited, thus if you want to be one of the first one to get a hold of it, be sure to know where to buy it from...like Suning. "This has led to further disappointment in the new phone. It is longer but can't even take videos. This generation of iPhone is terrible." Like the other iPhones, iPhone 7 had its share of secrets before being released. In addition, there are multiple sources claiming that the new generation of iPhone will not feature a 3.5mm headphone jack and use Bluetooth connectivity instead and will just have the charging port. This will provide space for Apple to add a second speaker. As evidence to backup this claim, Apple had developed earphones that would connect to the charging port back in 2014. Regardless of whether the rumors are true or not, we will only know for sure when it is announced in Apple's fall 2016 conference. However, this does not prevent the industry from looking at the potential specification of the iPhone 7 - many believe that the iPhone 7 will most likely be Apple's last major upgrade to the iPhone series. IDC, which is a market research institute recently released data that the market share of iPhone has declined. However, Goldman Sachs will maintain the "buy" rating for Apple's stock, and BMO analysts believe that iPhone7 will come together with a historic sales performance. Additionally, Broadcom’s CEO Hock Tan also stated that Apple’s future revenue growth may exceed 20%, all thanks to the launch of the iPhone 7. Seven percent of respondents said they had plans to purchase the iPhone 7, compared to only four percent who planned to purchase the iPhone 6 two years ago. It is understood that 20% of those currently using the iPhone 6 or 6 Plus plan to purchase the iPhone 7, which is a very high percentage. Also, experts analyzed that most of Apple consumers like to replace their iPhones every generation. According to the data, about 26% of all iPhone users have not changed their phones for 2 years. Which means almost 120 million people have used the iPhone for 2 years. Some media claimed that Taiwan faced several earthquakes during the production of iPhone 7 and, “The damage of TSMC's production facilities was bigger than expected and may affect the initial iPhone 7 supply.” The disparity between supply and demand will affect the average customers. It is time to choose a good place to buy an authentic iPhone 7 early at a lower price. According to informed sources, Suning executives met frequently with Apple in order to prepare enough stock. The company is already in discussion with Suning, and will inevitable provide a lower price and better service for consumers through a high-level of cooperation between the two parties. “At the lowest price, consumers may only need to pay 7 yuan a day to purchase the iPhone 7.” Plentiful stock and various services will make purchasing the iPhone less stressful. Through Suning's logistics, will further lead to a heightened buying experience. You may perhaps get a call in the middle of a night which will say "Hi this is Suning.com. Your iPhone 7 is here."</div>
	<div class="translation" id="b2d-18">Although it has yet to be proven, many information sources indicate that Apple will hold its 2016 Fall event in September. iPhone 7 is really on its way. Although Apple did not respond, news concerning the functions and configuration of the iPhone are being released gradually. Pictures of the "actual phone model" have even appeared on the Internet. The new iPhone could be considered a "public phenomenon". It's popular, sleek, and could not be acquired even if you have the money to pay for it. If you want to buy an original product, you must opt for a proper sales channel such as Suning. This heightened the people's sense of disappointment for the new cellphone. "It became longer, but couldn't project holographs! This iPhone release sucks." Like other iPhones, numerous anecdotes and secret information accompanied the iPhone 7 before its debut. Elsewhere, many sources of information also claimed that the 3.5mm headphone jack will be removed from the new iPhone to be replaced by bluetooth connection and the charging interface. This will give Apple room for adding a second speaker. Another piece of corroborative evidence is that as far back as 2014, Apple had already allowed headphone manufacturers to connect headphone products through the charging interface. The answer to such news, whether true or false, will only be revealed by Apple at the 2016 Fall launch event. This did not stop industry insiders from taking a positive view of the prospects of iPhone 7 however. Many believed that iPhone 7 could very well be the last time Apple would significantly upgrade the iPhone series. However, data recently published by IDC, a market intelligence firm, showed the market share of iPhone has decreased slightly. Goldman Sachs has rated Apple shares as something that can be "bought". BMO analysts believe that iPhone7 will establish a historical record in sales performance. Broadcom CEO Hock Tan also expressed that Apple is expected to achieve more than 20% growth in revenue. This figure can be completely attributed to the release of iPhone7. 7% of those interviewed said they intend to buy iPhone 7 compared to a mere 4% who planned to buy iPhone 6 two years ago. From information available, 20% of users currently holding an iPhone6 or 6Plus have plans for purchasing iPhone7. This proportion is quite substantial. Next, experts analyzed that most Apple fans like to replace their iPhone every other generation. Statistics revealed that among iPhone users, approximately 26% of users have not changed their mobile phones in two years, i.e., the iPhones of about 120 million users have been used for two years. Some media reported that Taiwan has been hit by several earthquakes during the iPhone7 production period. "Damages sustained by TSMC production facilities may have went beyond expectations, and that could have influenced initial supply for iPhone7." Supply and demand conflicts will influence normal users. It is time to select a proper channel and acquire an authentic iPhone7 early at a low price. Insider disclosure revealed that the upper management of Suning and Apple has met frequently in recent times for the purpose of preparing enough resources. Service operators have reached an agreement with Suning. It can be expected that with growing partnership between the two, users will be provided with lower prices and more dedicated services. " The lowest price. The customers might' only RMB 7 a day to get a iPhone7". Sufficient supply of goods and a variety of discounts, buyers of iPhone 7 will not be so stressed out, and Suning's logistics department will all the more turn this happiness into a more intuitive experience. Perhaps you will receive a phone call at midnight. "Hello, this is Suning.com. Your iPhone 7 has arrived."</div>

	<div class="source" id="b2d-19">虽说现在已经立秋，可是“秋老虎”的威力似乎一点不比夏天差。 紫外线不仅让同学们的皮肤变黑，更加会晒伤肌肤，如何让肌肤能顺利度过军训，不被晒伤？ 防晒霜包装上一般都标有SPF和PA，SPF是指防晒指数，是针对UVB紫外线的，我们常见的SPF指数有15、30、50等。 标有PA的产品是针对UVA的，这样防晒品会发挥更加有效的作用，通常情况下，PA的强度用+来表示，多一个+表示有效防护时间延长。 油性肌肤应选择渗透力较强的水性防晒用品，防晒喷雾也是不错的选择。 干性肌肤应选择霜状的防晒用品;中性皮肤一般无严格规定，敏感性肌肤擦上任何保养品都是一种负担，建议选纯物理性防晒产品。 切记提前半小时涂防晒霜，因为防晒产品需要时间才能完全渗入到皮肤。 军训日晒时间较长，防晒霜每隔两小时擦一次才能有持久效果，千万不要偷懒。 由于皮肤刚受到日晒刺激的缘故，军训回来不要立刻用美白产品。 军训暴晒后，如有条件可用毛巾包着冰块来冰镇被灼伤的皮肤以减缓局部燥热。</div>
	<div class="translation" id="b2d-19">Although it is now autumn, the hot weather after the beginning of autumn seems comparable to the summer. UV rays not only darkens your skin but can also cause sunburn. So how does one get through the rigorous military training without sunburn? Sunscreen generally features a SPF and PA mark. SPF is the measure of how well a sunscreen protects the skin from sunburn, and protect the skin from UVB rays. The common figures we see are SPF of 15, 30 and 50. Products with the PA mark is for UVA rays thus is a more effective sun screen. The strength of the PA is shown with + signs, and any additional + signs represents longer protection time. Those with oily skin should choose water-based sunscreen for deep protection. Sunscreen spray is also a good choice. Those with dry skin should use sunscreen cream and those with neutral skin are not bound with any rules. Any type of skin care products is not good for those with sensitive skin and a 100% pure sunscreen is recommended. It takes time for the sunscreen to seep in thus do not forget to apply the sunscreen 30 minutes beforehand. During the long military training, be sure to apply sunscreen once every two hours to keep it effective. Don't get lazy. The skin is exposed greatly to the sun during military training thus do not use skin whitening products right away. After military training, if possible, wrap ice cubes with a towel and apply it to your burnt skin to cool it down.</div>
	<div class="translation" id="b2d-19">Although autumn has arrived, the bite of the "autumn tiger" has proved to be no less powerful than that of the summer. UV not only darkens the skin, it will also cause sunburns. Is there any solution to help the skin make it through military training and avoid sunburns altogether? The external packaging of sunblock cream is often labeled with SPF and PA. SPF refers to the sun protection factor and specifically targets UVB radiation. Common SPF scores include 15, 30, and 50. Products with the PA label are aimed at UVA. Such sunblocks are more effective. Generally, the strength of PA is indicated by the + sign. Each additional + represents a longer duration of effective protection. For oily skin, choose aqueous sunblock with good penetrability. Sunblock sprays are good options as well. For dry skin, use cream-based anti-sunburn products. Those with neutral skin are not subject to stringent regulations. However, sensitive skin will find application of any product to be a hard burden. Purely physical sunblock products are recommended. Remember to apply the sunblock cream half an hour earlier as the anti-sunburn product needs some time before completely penetrating the skin. Military training includes extended exposure to solar radiation. Anti-sunburn cream must be applied once every 2 hours to sustain the effects. Don't get lazy about this. Since the skin has just been sensitized by exposure to the sun, do not use whitening products immediately after military training. For sunburns endured during military training, ice wrapped in towels can be used to cool scorched skin and alleviate local senses of over-heating.</div>

	<div class="translation" id="b2d-21">On the surface, the social networking platform has expanded the circle of communication and reduced people's loneliness. The social circle of cyberspace has become more and more common. It has not only gradually replaced the traditional means of communication by phone, but is also affecting our social circles. It is quietly changing the social lives of people. The benefits of social networking online are obvious, such as the convenience, and especially cater to the young generation. A survey on college students’ social habits shows that 57% of college students spend more than five hours a day using mobile phones, and it has become inseparable with their daily lives. "The social network has the characteristics of inexpensive, fast, and being able to network with a large crowd, which is in line with the needs of college students today." Expanding the circle of interpersonal relationships, a more equal dialogue, and avoiding social concerns are the main reasons why we love chatting online more. New company staffs likes to communicate with their coworkers online. "As many are not familiar with it, they communicated without borders which built a good relationship among them." People who like to make friends also like to use this. "There was an instance where I had lost contact with someone due to a misunderstanding. However I was able to connect with that person again by conversing in groups." Wu Yan, an IT engineer, is an in-depth social networking enthusiast. Most of his social life happens online, where the number of people online is several times more than those offline. Wu Yan admits that being online is "like being a fish in the water". "You can reply your friends at your own pace. You will be able to express yourself better as you have time to think about what to write." "You can stay behind your online ID and avoid face-to-face conflict; will have the peace of mind to think things out before taking action." "Two different people can come together and communicate at the same level. Thus the social concerns in real life seem to be non-existent online." However, Wu’s friend Xiaopeng thinks that Wu’s life is enclosed and abnormal. Xiaopeng and Wu Yan met in a large group and as they were both active talkers, they quickly became good friends. Xiaopeng felt that Wu Yan and two other people online were bland and did not actively express their opinions. Their replies were often "Oh, ok, really," or "Let me check online."</div>

The scope of influence of online social networking has become increasingly widespread. Not only has it gradually replaced traditional phone communication, it has even permeated actual offline living circles, quietly changing the social activities of the masses. The benefit of online social networking is obvious. It is easy and convenient, and is therefore much preferred by younger demographics. A survey investigating college student socializing habits found that 57% of college students spend more than 5 hours a day on cellphones, literally making cellphones "inseparable" during everyday lives. "The characteristics of social networks include being low-cost, having fast transmission rates, and allowing many people to interact simultaneously. This suits the needs of contemporary university students. Expanded relationship circles, being able to chat on equal footing, and avoidance of social stigma are the main reasons why we become increasingly fond of online chat. The newcomers enjoy online communication with other employees, " because we are not familiar with each other at the beginning. But the 'like' and comment in the social media will close the distance." People who enjoy making friends also used online networking. "I haven't been contacting a friend for a while due to some misunderstanding. We then shared a few words in a larger group and things got better from there." IT engineer Wu Yan is strong fan for social networking, and spends most of his socializing time and life online, with many more online contacts than friends he meet offline. Wu Yan himself honestly said that he feels like "fish returned to the water" when he goes online. "You may reply to a friend when you are willing at a time that is convenient for you to do so because there is plenty of time for you to deliberate the wordings, and you can also express yourself more clearly." "The ID provides one with a cover to avoid all face-to-face interpersonal conflicts, providing one with more room to maneuver and also provided both sides with more time and space to think about what they say." "People of different status are given the same rights to speech and the same voice. Various social taboos in real life seem to disappear in the online world." Xiaopeng, a friend of Wu Yan, felt that the real life Wu Yan is a "boring geek". Xiaopeng and Wu Yan met in a big group. As they were both active speakers, they became acquainted very quickly. Xiaopeng felt that Wu Yan was completely different from his online personality. The real Wu Yan used little words and never gave any opinions. The only phrases he would use were: "Ho ho. Alright.

	<div class="source" id="b2d-22">可惜，OPEC最新月报显示出7月原油产量继续增加，沙特产量更创下新高。 这份报告不禁令市场对OPEC的信誉产生怀疑，油价复苏的道路恐怕仍然布满荆棘。 本周一，OPEC轮值主席兼卡塔尔能源大臣萨达表示，OPEC将在9月26-28日的国际能源论坛期间举行非正式会议。 OPEC周三公布的月报显示，包括加蓬在内的整个OPEC组织7月产量上升4.6万桶/日，至3311万桶/日。 OPEC还在月报中表示，原油价格低廉已促使全球炼油商生产更多精炼油品，从而加重了市场供应过剩的程度。 受此消息影响，再加上美国上调原油产量预期和原油库存意外增加，国际油价连续两日收跌。 截至周三收盘，纽约商品交易所9月交货的轻质原油期货价格下跌2.48%，10月交货的伦敦布伦特原油期货价格下跌2.07%。 路透社认为，提议召开的产油国会议不太可能令供应明显收紧，美国能源信息署公布的数据也打压市场人气。 伊朗官方通讯社Fars周三援引伊朗石油部长赞加内的发言称，伊朗的日原油产量最高为385万桶，这是2008年以来的最高水平。 召开会议的消息刚出，俄罗斯能源部长诺瓦克就表示，当前油价下没有进行新一轮冻产谈判的必要。 上次产油国召开会议已经是4月份的事情，OPEC成员国未能就任何措施达成协议。 BMIResearch石油与天然气分析师理查兹（Emma Richards）表示，市场和媒体可能对OPEC将召开的会议反应过度。 加拿大皇家银行大宗商品策略主管克罗夫特（Helima Croft）表示，OPEC通过释放他们将促成协议的信号来改变市场的情绪。 这个手段就像是引开人视线的烟雾与镜子（故意给人错误印象）。 德国商业银行大宗商品研究主管温伯格（Eugen Weinberg）称，人们认为OPEC试图通过9月会议稳定市场的可能性很低。 这很可能进一步破坏市场对OPEC的信心，毕竟这个组织上演过一次“狼来了”。</div>
	<div class="translation" id="b2d-22">Unfortunately, the latest OPEC monthly report shows that crude oil production continued to increase in July, and Saudi Arabia's production hit a new high. This report doesn't prevent the market from doubting OPEC. The road to recovery for oil price seems to be a tough one. On Monday, Sada who is OPEC's president and Qatar's Energy Minister said that OPEC will hold an informal meeting during the International Energy Forum on September 26-28. The monthly report released by OPEC on Wednesday showed that all OPEC members including Gabon increased their July production by an additional 46,000 barrels per day to 33.11 million barrels per day. OPEC also said in its monthly report that low crude oil prices have prompted the world's refiners to produce more refined oil products, which has increased the level of excess supply in the market. The international oil price fell for two consecutive days with this news and as the US raised their forecast on crude oil production along with the unexpected increase in crude oil inventory. As of Wednesday's close, the New York Mercantile Exchange's September delivery of light crude oil futures fell 2.48%, and the October delivery of London Brent crude oil futures fell 2.07%. Reuters believes that the proposed meeting of oil-producing countries is unlikely to significantly tighten supply, and data released by the US Energy Information Administration also weighed on market sentiment. Iran’s official news agency Fars quoted Iran’s oil minister Zaganga’s statement on Wednesday, saying that Iran’s maximum daily crude oil output was 3.85 million barrels, which is the highest level since 2008. The result of the meeting was just announced and the Russian Energy Minister Novak stated that there is no need for a new round of negotiations on production freeze with the current oil price. The meeting with the oil-producing country was back in April. OPEC member states were not able to reach an agreement whatsoever.  Emma Richards, an oil and gas analyst at BMI Research, said that the market and the media may be a bit too sensitive to the OPEC meeting. Helima Croft, head of commodities strategy at Royal Bank of Canada, said that OPEC changed market sentiment by releasing signals that they would facilitate the deal. This is like the smoke and mirror method of drawing away attention (and giving the wrong impression). Eugen Weinberg, Head of Commodity Research at Commerzbank AG, said that people think that OPEC is unlikely to try to stabilize the market through the September meeting. This is likely to further undermine the market's confidence in OPEC, after all, the organization has already pulled "the boy who cried wolf."</div>

	<div class="source" id="b2d-27">国家发展改革委产业协调司负责人今天在此间指出，钢铁产能过剩是全球性问题。 我国近年产能利用率均高于全球平均水平，也高于美欧等国家和地区。 我国已经采取坚决有效的措施化解过剩产能，而且成效正在逐步显现。 该负责人指出，对钢铁产能过剩这一全球性问题，党中央国务院高度重视。 各部门、各地区积极贯彻落实国务院部署，认真开展工作，今年要压减粗钢产能4500万吨左右。 从我国国情出发，我国并不鼓励钢材出口，相反，还采取一系列切实措施控制钢材出口。 这位负责人强调，钢铁产品国际贸易本质上讲是市场行为，是源于进口国需求、消费者综合考虑产品性价比等因素后的自主选择。 实施贸易保护措施无助于从根本上解决全球钢铁产业的发展问题，相反，只会对国际贸易秩序造成进一步冲击。 在谈到债务时，该负责人强调，化解债务问题是化解过剩产能过程中需要妥善处理好的重要问题。 由于钢铁企业资产规模大，涉及面广，一些企业的债务关系复杂，如果处置不当，有可能引发区域性风险。 据该负责人介绍，近年来，随着经济下行压力加大，社会总需求逐步减弱，部分行业产能利用率下降，企业生产经营困难加大。 一些企业不适应市场环境变化，生产经营难以为继甚至濒临倒闭，但受一些体制机制因素制约，以市场化方式退出的障碍较多，成为“僵尸企业”。 这类企业的存在，扭曲了市场信号，降低了要素资源利用效率，增加了社会管理成本，妨碍了公平竞争市场环境的建立。 导致亏损的主要原因与全球钢铁行业面临的困境一样——市场需求不振、产能利用率低。 我国主要采取市场机制、经济手段和法治办法，政府主要是做好职工兜底和社会稳定工作，保证公平公正的市场秩序。 这位负责人强调，下一步，要坚定不移继续抓好去产能工作，确保完成5年化解粗钢产能1亿~1.5亿吨的目标任务。</div>
	<div class="translation" id="b2d-27">The head of the Industrial Coordination Department of the National Development and Reform Commission said here today that steel overcapacity is a global problem. In recent years, China's capacity utilization rate is higher than the global average and higher than the United States and Europe and other countries and regions. China has taken resolute and effective measures to eliminate excess capacity, and the results are gradually emerging. The person in charge pointed out that the party Central Committee and the State Council attach great importance to the global problem of excess steel production capacity. Various departments and regions have actively implemented the State Council's plan and carried out serious work to reduce crude steel production capacity by about 45 million tons this year. Proceeding from China's national conditions, China does not encourage steel exports, on the contrary, it has also taken a series of practical measures to control steel exports. The official stressed that international trade in steel products is essentially a market behavior, is derived from the importing country demand, consumers comprehensive consideration of product value for money and other factors after the independent choice. The implementation of trade protection measures will not help to fundamentally solve the problem of the development of the global steel industry, on the contrary, it will only cause further impact on the international trade order. When talking about debt, the chief stressed that resolving the debt problem is an important issue that needs to be properly handled in the process of resolving excess capacity. Due to the large scale and wide range of assets of steel enterprises, the debt relationship of some enterprises is complex, and it is possible to trigger regional risks if not handled properly. In recent years, as downward pressure on the economy has increased, aggregate demand in society has gradually weakened, capacity utilization rates in some sectors have declined and enterprises have greater difficulties in production and operation, according to the chief. Some enterprises do not adapt to changes in the market environment, production and operation is difficult to sustain or even close down, but subject to some institutional and institutional factors, there are more obstacles to exit in a market-oriented way and become "zombie enterprises." The existence of such enterprises distorts market signals, reduces the efficiency of factor resource utilization, increases the cost of social management and hinders the establishment of a level playing field. The main reasons for the losses are the same as those faced by the global steel industry - weak market demand and low capacity utilisation. Our country mainly adopts the market mechanism, economic means and the method of rule of law, and the government mainly does a good job in the work of the bottom line and social stability of the staff and workers to ensure a fair and just market order. The person in charge stressed that the next step is to continue to work hard to ensure the completion of the five-year target of 100 million to 150 million tons of crude steel production capacity.</div>
	<div class="translation" id="b2d-27">Today, the head of the Industry Coordination Department of the National Development and Reform Commission pointed out that the excess capacity of steel is a global issue. In recent years, China's capacity utilization rate has been higher than the global average. It is also higher than the United States and Europe and in other countries. China has taken quick and effective measures to resolve the issue of overproduction, and is gradually coming into effect. The person in charge pointed out that the Central Committee and the State Council excess capacity of steel is a global issue. All departments and regions actively implemented the State Council's orders and actively carried them out. The crude steel production capacity this year should be reduced by around 45 million tons. From a national standpoint, China does not encourage the export of steel products. Instead, it adopts a series of practical measures to control the export of steel products. The person in charge emphasized that international trade of steel products is a market-driven decision made by the needs of the importing country based on the price and other factors. The implementation of trade protection measures will not fundamentally solve the problem of global steel industry development. On the contrary, it will only cause further issues to the international market. The person in charge also emphasized that resolving the deficit issue is important and needs to be resolved properly and concurrently with the issue of excess capacity. As the asset and scope of steel making companies are massive, the debt issue of some companies are complex and there will be a regional risk if it is not handled appropriately. According to the person in charge, in recent years, as the pressure of economic downturn has increased, the total social demand has gradually weakened, and the capacity utilization rate of some industries has declined. As a result, the production and operation of enterprises have become increasingly difficult. Some enterprises are unable adapt to the changes in the market, thus production and management are difficult to sustain and lead to bankruptcy. However, due to the constraints of some institutional mechanisms, there are many obstacles to market-based withdrawal which leads to companies becoming "zombie companies". The existence of such enterprises has distorted market signals, reduced resource utilization efficiency, increased social management costs, and hindered the establishment of a fair market environment. The main cause of losses is the same as the predicament faced by the global steel industry. Basically the market demand is weak and capacity utilization is low. Our country mainly adopts market mechanisms, economic instruments, and regulations. The government mainly does a good job for all employees and provide social stability to ensure a fair market. The person in charge emphasized that in the next step, we must diligently continue to do a good job in the production capacity and ensure that the target of reducing 100 to 150 million tons of crude steel production capacity is completed in five years.</div>

On the morning of the 10th, the pool for water polo next to the diving pool also turned green. Australian Water Polo players said after the game that his eyes were stinging and was teary. The officials of the Rio Olympics confirmed earlier that the water in the pool turned green, and said that the discoloration of the pool water was due to weaker alkaline conditions and would not affect the physical health of the athletes. However, Australian athletes said after winning the match against the Japanese team in the water polo pool, they felt a tingling pain in their eyes. When the diving pool first turned green, the organizers worked overtime on the 9th to resolve the issue at the diving pool. However, in the early morning of the 10th, they discovered that the pool for water polo had suddenly turned green. The conditions of the water polo pool got worse during the match between Australia and Japan. Officials stressed that they will restore the water quality of the two pools to their original colors on the 11th. Mario Andrada, a spokesman for the Rio Olympic Games, said "The alkaline level of water in the diving pool weakened first yesterday afternoon." "We understand that one of the reasons that affect water quality and color is the alkalinity of water." The water sports center conducted a series of tests on water quality. Hundreds of divers and swimmers used the swimming pool to determine if the water quality condition meets the standards. ” "We have followed normal procedures in the last few days but we may have overlooked that the usage of the pool by more athletes could affect the water quality." "But we can say that the discoloration is not a health concern and will especially not affect the athletes." "This independent team confirmed our assessment and affirmed our measures to restore the pool to normal colors and normal chemical conditions." "We had hoped to restore the pool to its original color in the morning but the work was slowed down due to the rain."</div>

	<div class="source" id="b2d-37">格雷西亚是一只萌萌的雌性巨嘴鸟，浑身散发着热带雨林的气息。 在中美洲国家哥斯达黎加，巨嘴鸟格雷西亚和它的故事早已家喻户晓。 8月10日的新闻发布会上，术后康复的格雷西亚终于亮相，向人们展示它崭新的3D打印塑料鸟喙。 这只一年半前被人折断上喙、奄奄一息的巨嘴鸟，如今终于重获新生。 这一天不仅宣告着它已100%恢复健康，更是它搬进豪华鸟舍、与关心它的人类朋友们见面的日子。 初进新家的格雷西亚稍显腼腆，但不多时就变得活泼起来，在水盆里打滚嬉闹，用新喙吃葡萄。 为了提醒人们它曾经遭受的伤害，技术人员没有给它的新喙上色，而是保留了3D打印材料原有的白色。 鸟喙外是一层薄薄的角质鞘，里面中空，只有一些细细的骨质支撑杆交错排列。 虽然有这种内部加固成份，巨嘴鸟的喙还是脆弱，受到伤害时会破碎。 动物救助中心、鸟类学家和一家美国3D打印公司通力合作，为格雷西亚制作了好几个“试验喙”，终于造出最适合它的“完美喙”。 如今格雷西亚已能熟练使用新喙喝水、吃东西，甚至啄起细小谷粒。 “最终成品的设计花了大约2个月，打印出来只需4、5个小时。” “3D打印并不是未来技术，它已经实实在在走进了你我的生活。”美国SG3D打印公司董事长托马斯·朗格在接受新华国际记者采访时说。 2015年1月，在哥斯达黎加中部阿拉胡埃拉省格雷西亚的一个农场，浑身是血的巨嘴鸟格雷西亚被人发现。 当时它的上喙被一伙年轻人残忍折断，它完全无法进食，生命垂危。 格雷西亚的惨状经媒体报道后，在哥斯达黎加内外引起如潮的反对虐待动物呼声。 人们要求设立更为严格的动物保护法、加大对虐待者的惩罚力度。 人们自发前来，尽最大努力帮助格雷西亚尽可能恢复受伤前的生活。 甚至3D打印技术发明人查克·赫尔也参与到格雷西亚上喙的设计中来。 “格雷西亚的情况很特殊，它的上喙剩余部分不足1厘米，所以给安装新喙带来许多困难。” “我们先对格雷西亚扫描，然后设计、制作出一个稍长于它上喙剩余部分的延长假体，用粘胶固定在它的上喙上。” “这样可以减少对格雷西亚造成进一步侵入性伤害。”朗格对新华国际记者说。 在安装假体之前，工作人员每天都要为格雷西亚清理断喙，以防感染。 远在千里之外，巨嘴鸟格雷西亚的故事感动了著名纪录片导演葆拉·埃雷迪亚和探索新闻频道制片人约翰·霍夫曼。 他们记录下格雷西亚安装新喙过程中的点点滴滴，录制了一部纪录片《巨嘴鸟之国》，已于本月在动物星球频道上播放。 纪录片《巨嘴鸟之国》向人们展示，一只小小的巨嘴鸟是如何让一个国家为之改变、如何让国民都参与到反对虐待动物当中来。</div>
	<div class="translation" id="b2d-37">Grecia is an adorable female toucan that exudes a tropical feel. The story of Grecia the toucan has been known early on in the Central American country of Costa Rica. In the press release on August 30th, Grecia who recovered from the surgery showed off her new prosthetic 3D printed beak to the public. The toucan whose beak was hacked off by humans and was dying a year and half ago is now reborn. This day not only confirms that she is 100% healthy, but also is a day when she will be relocated to a luxurious cage and a day for those who care about her to be able to see her. Grecia was a bit shy after moving to her new home but became more lively as she played in the water and ate grapes with her new beak. The engineering specialist did not newly paint the 3D printed beak to serve as a reminder to people of what she went through, thus leaving it in the original white color of the 3D printing material. The outer layer of the beak features a thin wall of keratin, and the inside is generally hollow and is only supported by several thin bone struts. Despite the interior being reinforced, the toucan's beak is still frail and can break when damaged. With the collaboration with the animal rescue center, bird specialists, and a US 3D printing company, the group was able to create several "trial versions" to identify and finally create "the perfect one". Grecia can now skillfully use her new beak to drink water, eat, and even pick up small grains. "The design of the final product took around 2 months and the printing only took 4-5 hours." The president of SG3D Printing, Thomas Lange explained to Xinhua International during an interview that, "3D printing is not a technology of the future but has already stepped in to our lives". In January 2015, a bloodied toucan (Grecia) was found on a farm in Grecia, Alajuela Province located in central Costa Rica. The beak was brutally hacked off by a group of youngsters. She could not eat at all and was in critical condition. After the media covered the story of Grecia's tragic situation, it triggered a wave of opposition on animal cruelty in and outside of Costa Rica. People have since called out for a stricter animal protection law and for harsher penalties for animal abuse. People proactively came together to do their best to help Grecia recover and regain her life before being injured. Chuck Hall who is the inventor of 3D printing was also involved in the design of Grecia's beak. "Grecia's situation was a very special one as there was less than 1 cm of the upper jaw left, which caused many difficulties in attaching the beak." "We first scanned Grecia then designed an extended cap that was a bit longer than the remnant beak, then glued the prosthetic beak". Lange told the reporters of Xinhua International that "By doing so, we can prevent further injury for Grecia". Before installing the prosthetic beak, the staff had to keep Grecia clean everyday to prevent infections. The story of Grecia the toucan travelled the distance and touched John Hoffman who is a producer at Discovery News Channel and Paul Heredia who is a famous documentary director. They filmed bits and pieces of the installation of Grecia's new beak to make a documentary called "Toucan Nation" which was aired on Animal Planet this month. The documentary "Toucan Nation" shows how a small Toucan inspired a nation to make changes and citizens to get involved to stop animal cruelty.</div>
	<div class="translation" id="b2d-37">Gracia is a budding female toucan with the scent of a tropical rainforest. In the Central American country of Costa Rica, the toucan Gracia and its story have long been a household name. At a press conference on August 10, Gracia, who is recovering from surgery, finally appeared to show off her brand-new, 3D printed plastic beak. The dying toucan, which had its beak snapped off a year and a half ago, has been given a new lease of life. This day heralds not only its 100 per cent return to health, but also its move into the luxurious aviary and its meeting with human friends who care about it. Gracia, who had just entered her new home, was a little shy, but soon became active, wallowing in the basin and eating the grapes with her new beak. To remind people of the damage it has suffered, instead of painting its new beak, technicians have kept the original white of the 3D printing material. The beak is covered with a thin, horny sheath that is hollow inside, with only a few thin, bone-supporting poles interlaced. Despite this internal reinforcement, the toucan's beak is still fragile and will break when it is damaged. The Animal Rescue Center, ornithologists and an American 3D printing company worked together to create several "experimental beaks" for Gracia, finally creating the "perfect beak" for her. Gracia is now adept at using her new beak to drink, eat and even pick up tiny grains. "The final product took about two months to design and only four or five hours to print." "3D printing is not the technology of the future, it has really come into your life and mine," Thomas Langer, chairman of SG3D printing company, told Xinhua International. Gracia, a toucan covered in blood, was discovered on a farm in Gracia, in the central Alajuela province of Costa Rica, in January 2015. At that time, its beak was brutally broken by a group of young people, it was completely unable to eat, life-threatening. The tragedy in Gracia has caused a flurry of calls against animal cruelty in and around Costa Rica after media reports. There have been calls for stricter animal protection laws and greater penalties for abusers. People came spontaneously and did their best to help Gracia get back to life as much as possible before the injury. Even Chuck Hull, the inventor of 3D printing technology, was involved in the design of Gracia's upper beak. "The case of Gracia is unique in that the remaining part of its upper beak is less than one centimetre, which makes it difficult to install a new beak," he said. "We scanned Gracia and then designed and made an extended prosthesis that was slightly longer than the rest of her upper beak. "This will reduce further invasive damage to Gracia," Langer told Xinhua International. Before installing the prosthesis, staff had to clean up Gracia's beak every day to prevent infection. Thousands of miles away, the story of Toucan Gracia moved famous documentary filmmaker Paula Heredia and Discovery News producer John Hoffman. They chronicled the installation of Gracia's new beak and recorded a documentary, "Land of the Toucans," which was shown on Animal Planet this month. The documentary "Land of Toucans" shows how a tiny toucan can make a country change for itself, and how it can involve its citizens in the fight against animal cruelty.</div>

	<div class="translation" id="b2d-42">Statistics on high temperature days of various districts provided on portal website of the Chongqing City Meteorological Administration said that with the exception of Youyang County, every area in the city could receive varying amounts of high temperature subsidies. Currently, at least 28 provinces in the country have clarified their subsidy disbursement criteria, but the disbursement criteria differs among provinces. In Chongqing, high-temperature subsidy is received based on subsidy for high-temperature working days. At temperatures equal or more than 35℃ and less than 37℃, each person shall be given a fee of not less than RMB10 per day. At temperatures higher than 37℃, each person shall be given a fee of not less than RMB15 per day. Workers working at above a temperature of 40℃ can receive a monthly subsidy of up to 20 RMB per day (this does not apply to a worker who is already provided with a high temperature operation subsidy according to law). According to this criteria, Kaizhou, which experienced the most number of high-temperature days last month would receive RMB330, while Chengkou which experienced the least number of days would received RMB80. As the highest temperature in Youyang did not exceed the high temperature benchmark, it did not receive any high-temperature subsidy. In the past, many companies often use cooling and refreshing beverages to offset the high temperature subsidy. The city administration of work safety, however, expressed that this act is not compliant to the current laws. Employers may not deduct or reduce the salary of laborers if work has to be suspended or work time reduced due to high temperatures. The municipal human resources and social security bureau said that workers who worked under high temperatures without receiving high temperature allowance may fight for their legal rights by way of the labor dispute mediation mechanism, or call 12333 to file a complaint. In case employer refuse to pay high-temperature allowance, employee is entitled to complain to the local administrative authority of HR and social security at the county level. Also, since the high temperature subsidy is considered part of the salary and not a benefit, it is included in total salary and subject to the personal income tax. High temperature subsidies are not included considered part of the minimum wage and must be issued in the form of cash. They cannot be replaced in the form of beverages or other tangible items.</div>
	<div class="translation" id="b2d-42">According to statistics of the Chongqing Municipal Meteorological Bureau portal on the high-temperature weather in various districts and counties except Fuyang, the rest of the city may have a deviance on the high temperature. Currently, there are at least 28 provinces in China that have clearly defined the standards for the subsidy. However, the standards issued by provinces and cities are not the same. Chongqing, on one other hand, receives heat allowances in the form of heat allowances on weekdays. If the temperature is 35°C to 37°C , a rate of not less than 10 yuan per person per day; if it exceeds 37°C, the rate shall not be less than 15 yuan per person per day. Workers working in high temperature environment above 40°C can receive up to 20 yuan per day per month (except for laborers who already receive the heat allowance according to law). According to this standard, Kaizhou, had the most days of high-temperature weather last month, and was able to receive 330 yuan, and Chengkou had the least number of days which equated to 80 yuan. The highest temperature recorded in Puyang did not reach the high temperature standard, so there was no heat allowance. In the past, many would give cold drinks instead of heat allowances. The City Work Safety Administration stated that such practices are not in line with current regulations. The employer may not deduct or reduce the wages of workers due to the stoppage of work due to high temperature and reduce working hours. The Municipal Bureau of Human Resources and Social Affairs stated that when an employee faces a situation where a the work environment is considered high-temperature but does not receive a heat allowance, he or she can seek legal rights through the labor dispute mediation agency where the company is located, or call 12333 to file a complaint. Where a company refuses to issue a heat allowance, the laborer may complain to the appropriate department in human resources and social security at or above the county level where the employment is located.

	<div class="translation" id="b2d-43">Greenlandic sharks, also known as sleeping sharks, are widely distributed in the North Atlantic Ocean around Greenland and Iceland and reach an adult length of 4 to 5 meters. But they grow extremely slowly, sometimes only about 1cm a year, suggesting that Greenland sharks may have an extraordinarily long life. Traditional dating methods typically use calcified tissue from animals, and some sharks may use fins, but this calcified tissue is rare in Greenland sharks. The new study, led by Julius Nielsen of the University of Copenhagen in Denmark, turned to radiocarbon dating using the eye lens of the Greenland shark. The method has previously been used to determine the age of whales, but it is the first time it has been used to determine the age of fish such as sharks. Their analysis showed that the largest shark had an estimated lifespan of 392 years, with a margin of error of 120 years. This means that the shark is at least 272 years old and is likely to reach a maximum of 512 years old. In addition, female Greenland sharks reportedly do not reach sexual maturity until they are about 4 metres in length, which translates into an age of at least 156 years. As a result, the researchers wrote in their paper, the Greenland shark is the longest-living vertebrate known on Earth, surpassing the previous long-lived champion right whale (211 years old).</div>

	<div class="translation" id="b2d-54">"Environmental issues are reflected in the atmosphere, water and land pollution but the problem still stems from our production and lifestyle." For example, the land development percentage in Jiangsu Province in 2015 was as high as 21%, which puts it the highest in the provinces and autonomous regions. Therefore, the problem of high pollution, large energy usage, and land occupation has not yet been fundamentally dealt with from the change in production and lifestyle. On one hand, Jiangsu Province ranks first in the country on the effectiveness of the use of land; however, on the other hand, it places a large burden on the resource and environment. To promote ecological environmental protection and governance thoroughly, we must fundamentally promote changes in production and lifestyle to benefit the people.</div>

For example, in 2015, the extent of land development in Jiangsu Province was 21%, the highest among all provinces and autonomous regions in the country. Therefore, there has been a lack of radical response to issues pertaining to heavy pollution, big energy and large land coverage in terms of a change in production methods and lifestyle. On the one hand, based on the results of the establishment of various levels and types of ecological environment in Jiangsu Province, it ranks first on an overwhelming basis. On the other hand, however, the resource environment in under significant pressure. Effective promotion of ecological conservation and governance requires a fundamental transformation of production methods and lifestyles.
