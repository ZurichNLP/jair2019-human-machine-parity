	<div class="translation" id="m2d-4">Once a new life is born to this world, the parents shall bear the responsibility for this life. This responsibility is not only the physical well-being, but also mental development which is education. If you succeed in your business but disregard your child's education, it will not be enough to makeup for the failure of your life and family. When a child is born, new fathers and mothers needs to be responsible and spend time to look after and educate the child. Responsibility of a child not only covers the physical well-being but also to educate them and help them develop mentally. Basically, let the child learn how to behave, grow up, and succeed. A good family environment is one where parents will always be with the child, and take care of the child whole-heartedly. Parents also needs to teach their child how to learn and become civilized. A parent's words and actions can affect how the child grows up. As a child would imitate parent's actions, there is a Chinese saying that a dragon will come from a dragon, a phoenix will come from a phoenix, and the child of a mouse will make holes, which basically means the whatever the parents do, the child will do the same. Therefore, parents have to a good role-model for their child. Parent's should strive to improve themselves and be careful of what you say and do as they can all cultivate a child's good character and become a better person.</div>
	<div class="translation" id="m2d-4">After a baby is born, parents must assume responsibility for this life. This responsibility does not merely concern the physical health of the child but also mental development, i.e. education. Failing in children's education is a loss in life and family that cannot be compensated by success in career-building. When a life is born, the new parents must spend time and effort to take care and educate the child, and be responsible to it. To become responsible, in addition to caring for the body, providing them with a healthy and spiritual education, the children are taught how to socialize properly, become responsible adults, and gain success. Good family education means that parents must spend time with their children often and provide them with love, patient care, and teach them how to develop well-mannered speech and behavior, allowing children to achieve better learning and improvements to their mental skills. Every saying and act of parents will influence the development of their child. The child will often mimic their parents, just like the traditional saying that goes: "A dragon gives birth to a dragon, a phoenix gives rise to a phoenix. A rat's child will eventually learn to dig holes." The child will take after its parents. Parents must provide a good role model in front of their children, control their words and saying, and develop an excellent character of their own. All this can indirectly help build a positive personality in children and make them more successful.</div>

	<div class="translation" id="m2d-5">On August 11th, when a reporter returned a call to Huang Yilin in Mianyang, Sichuan, she said “The situation was too dire at the time and the only thought I had in my mind was to save people!”. Huang Yilin is a student from Central South University of Forestry and Technology for the class of 2015. Huang Yilin, who was studying urban and rural planning, wanted to visit Sichuan Zhongzhong to learn about the local architectural design, thus travelled together with her family. At around 10:00 on August 8, Huang Yilin’s father was resting at the hotel, while Huang Yilin and her mom went out to walk around Langzhong Ancient City. Without venturing too far, they saw a group of people yelling and screaming thus went up to see what the commotion was about. She saw that "the boy was already out of sight and the girl was desperately trying to stay above water with only half her head visible as her head bobbled up and down in the river". Huang Yilin had learned how to swim when she was young and jumped in quickly to save the child. After diving in, Huang Yilin realized that despite being 165 cm tall, her feet could not touch the bottom of the river!  Although the surface of the river seemed calm, the current was strong underneath!  But she was still determined to swim toward the girl. Huang Yilin said that the river was muddy and turbulent and she had to use almost all her strength to reach the girl who was less than 5 meters away. She tried her best to push the little girl to the edge of the river bank. "The slope was very slippery and I was afraid that I would use up my energy and sink." Huang Yilin called out to her mom for help. Her mom heard her cry for help and was about to go in the water and help. However as her mom was not in proper attire, she was stopped by a tourist beside her. On August 10th, after Huang Yilin jumped in the river to save the child, her mom was bombarded with comments, compliments, and "questions" from friends and relatives. "If you look back at it now, it was really scary! To be honest, when she could barely hold on to the riverbank and called to me for help, my heart almost shattered." Ms. Yin said that despite being dangerous, she would still support her daughter's decision if something like this happened again. She was very proud of her daughter!  Because Huang Yilin was forced to learn swimming, she never really swam after learning how to swim but "never thought it would come in handy in such a situation." According to the introduction of Huang Yilin's class leader Chen Yi-yang, Huang Yi-lin is recognized as an "honor student" and likes to help others.</div>
	<div class="translation" id="m2d-5">On August 11, when the reporter's telephone interview reached Huang Yilin who has returned to her home at Jinyang in Sichuan, she said: "It was an emergency. The only thing I could think of is to rescue people." Huang Yiling is a student of the 2015 cohort of the Landscape Architecture School in the Central South University Forestry and Technology. Huang Yilin who is now studying the professional field of town and country planning wishes to visit Langzhong in Sichuan to learn about architecture in that region, and thus took the entire family to a trip to that location. At about 10 am on August 8, Huang Yilin's father was resting at the hotel, while she and her mother were getting ready to wander about Langzhong Ancient City. After walking for a short distance, they saw a small crowd screaming and yelling, and approached them out of curiosity. Seeing that the "little boy has disappeared and that the little girl is splashing around in the water, with her head bobbing up and down the river water as the water keeps dragging her down", Huang Yilin, who had learned swimming at a young age, jumped into the water to save the child. After jumping into the river, 165-meter tall Huang Yilin realized she could not find the bottom! The water surface which seemed serene previously hid powerful currents underneath. But she did everything she could to swim toward the little girl. Huang Yilin said that the river was muddy and rapid. She was almost spent swimming a distance of less than 5 meters. She used her entire strength to push the little girl to the side of the levee. "The slope is so slipper. I thought I might sink when I run out of power." Huang Yilin therefore cried out to her mother for help. Upon hearing her daughter's cries, Mdm Yin, who was not a good swimmer, decided to go into the water but was stopped by other swimmers. On August 10, after the story of Huang Yilin leaping into the river to save a girl spread, Mdm Yin received plenty of words of comfort and praise from family members and friends, as well as "blame" from many. " I still feel the linger fear! To tell you the truth, my heart was broken when the kid almost fading on the bank cried out for help. Fear still lingered in Mdm Yin's heart. Despite the dangers, Mdm Yin said that she would still support the choice made by her daughter under such circumstances and felt proud for what she did. Huang Yilin seldom took the initiative to go swimming after she learned the skill because she was forced into it. "Who would have thought it would come in handy." According to Huang Yilin's class monitor Chen Yiyang, the class has long regarded Huang Yilin as the "top-scoring student" and knew that she is willing to help others.</div>

	<div class="translation" id="m2d-12">Toll collection started on September 1 for the Laowanfu River and Beidaliu navigation channels after their upgrades and reconstruction. These navigation channels are part of the Grand Canal.  The costs for the upgrades and reconstruction for these two will be covered with social financing, and the costs have been approved by the appropriate departments of the provincial government.  The Laowanfu River passes through Jinxiang and Yutai before linking with the Grand Canal through Nanyang Lake. Laowanfu River is a total of 32.5 kilometers. According to navigation requirements, the Laowanfu River waterway will need to adopt a proper maintenance method, deepen the water level, and straighten the channel, to improve the navigation conditions.  The waterway that goes through Jinxiang County and Rencheng District which then enters the main navigation channel of the Grand Canal via Nanyang Lake is 19 kilometers long. The work on the two channels started in February 2011 and was completed in January 2015. The principal for the investment and construction was by the Jining City Anping Canal Logistics Service Center. Based on the “paying off loans with a service fee” principle, the Anping Canal Logistics Service Center of Jining City will collect toll fees subject to the standards approved by the Shandong Provincial Price Bureau. One of such standard is the base toll calculated at 1.75 yuan/dwt, and a toll mileage of 0.05 yuan/km dwt. The toll collection period is from June 15, 2016 to June 14th, 2019. Reporters learned from the Jining City Port and Navigation Bureau that there are currently 4 tolled waterway in Jining consisting of Weishui River, Baima River, Beidake River, and Laowanfu River. The 4 waterways are tributaries of the Grand Canal and were upgraded via social financing. The Weishui River upgrade project was the first to feature the collaborative "Government + Market" model for waterway improvement in the Shangdong Province. The Government funded most of it while social funding was used to cover the balance. Baima River, Laowanfu River and Beidake River projects were done purely for the interest of the market. The budget allocated from the state finance is not enough to cover the cost of the project construction, and would impede on the upgrade progress of the channels. The use of social funding for the construction of public infrastructure meets the requirements of national policies and has also become a way to overcome funding issues.</div>

The reconstruction of the two waterways began in February 2011 and was completed in January 2015, with the investment, construction and operation of Jining Anping Canal Logistics Service Center. In accordance with the principle of "loan construction, fee repayment", Jining Anping Canal Logistics Service Center collects waterway tolls according to the toll standards approved by the Shandong Provincial Price Bureau. Among them, the basic toll is charged at 1.75 yuan / deadweight tons, and the mileage toll is charged at 0.05 yuan / kilometer load-bearing tons. Tolls will be collected from 15 June 2016 until 14 June 2019. The reporter learned from the port and navigation bureau of jining that there are currently four toll channels in jining, namely, the soshui river channel, the baima river channel, the beidaliu channel, the old wanfu river channel. The four waterways are tributaries of the Beijing-Hangzhou Grand Canal, all of which have been upgraded by means of social financing. Zhu Shuihe waterway upgrading and reconstruction project is the first to adopt the "government + market" model for the inland river port in Shandong Province, infrastructure construction projects, the government accounted for the main investment, social funds to supplement the funding gap. Baima River, the old Wanfu River, North Daliaohe and other feeder channels to take a purely market-oriented mode of operation. The funds allocated by the state finance can not meet the needs of the construction project and restrict the progress of the upgrading of the waterway. Social funds for the construction of public infrastructure in line with the requirements of national policy, but also become the way to crack the bottleneck of funds.</div>

	<div class="translation" id="m2d-18">It has not yet been confirmed yet, but many sources have indicated that Apple's 2016 fall conference will be held in September. The iPhone 7 is really going to come out. Although Apple did not comment, information and specification of the new iPhone has been released and there are "actual" photos of the iPhone 7 on the web. The new generation of the iPhone is going to be slick, popular, and limited, thus if you want to be one of the first one to get a hold of it, be sure to know where to buy it from...like Suning. "This has led to further disappointment in the new phone. It is longer but can't even take videos. This generation of iPhone is terrible." Like the other iPhones, iPhone 7 had its share of secrets before being released. In addition, there are multiple sources claiming that the new generation of iPhone will not feature a 3.5mm headphone jack and use Bluetooth connectivity instead and will just have the charging port. This will provide space for Apple to add a second speaker. As evidence to backup this claim, Apple had developed earphones that would connect to the charging port back in 2014. Regardless of whether the rumors are true or not, we will only know for sure when it is announced in Apple's fall 2016 conference. However, this does not prevent the industry from looking at the potential specification of the iPhone 7 - many believe that the iPhone 7 will most likely be Apple's last major upgrade to the iPhone series. IDC, which is a market research institute recently released data that the market share of iPhone has declined. However, Goldman Sachs will maintain the "buy" rating for Apple's stock, and BMO analysts believe that iPhone7 will come together with a historic sales performance. Additionally, Broadcom’s CEO Hock Tan also stated that Apple’s future revenue growth may exceed 20%, all thanks to the launch of the iPhone 7. Seven percent of respondents said they had plans to purchase the iPhone 7, compared to only four percent who planned to purchase the iPhone 6 two years ago. It is understood that 20% of those currently using the iPhone 6 or 6 Plus plan to purchase the iPhone 7, which is a very high percentage. Also, experts analyzed that most of Apple consumers like to replace their iPhones every generation. According to the data, about 26% of all iPhone users have not changed their phones for 2 years. Which means almost 120 million people have used the iPhone for 2 years. Some media claimed that Taiwan faced several earthquakes during the production of iPhone 7 and, “The damage of TSMC's production facilities was bigger than expected and may affect the initial iPhone 7 supply.” The disparity between supply and demand will affect the average customers. It is time to choose a good place to buy an authentic iPhone 7 early at a lower price. According to informed sources, Suning executives met frequently with Apple in order to prepare enough stock. The company is already in discussion with Suning, and will inevitable provide a lower price and better service for consumers through a high-level of cooperation between the two parties. “At the lowest price, consumers may only need to pay 7 yuan a day to purchase the iPhone 7.” Plentiful stock and various services will make purchasing the iPhone less stressful. Through Suning's logistics, will further lead to a heightened buying experience. You may perhaps get a call in the middle of a night which will say "Hi this is Suning.com. Your iPhone 7 is here."</div>
	<div class="translation" id="m2d-18">Although it has yet to be proven, many information sources indicate that Apple will hold its 2016 Fall event in September. iPhone 7 is really on its way. Although Apple did not respond, news concerning the functions and configuration of the iPhone are being released gradually. Pictures of the "actual phone model" have even appeared on the Internet. The new iPhone could be considered a "public phenomenon". It's popular, sleek, and could not be acquired even if you have the money to pay for it. If you want to buy an original product, you must opt for a proper sales channel such as Suning. This heightened the people's sense of disappointment for the new cellphone. "It became longer, but couldn't project holographs! This iPhone release sucks." Like other iPhones, numerous anecdotes and secret information accompanied the iPhone 7 before its debut. Elsewhere, many sources of information also claimed that the 3.5mm headphone jack will be removed from the new iPhone to be replaced by bluetooth connection and the charging interface. This will give Apple room for adding a second speaker. Another piece of corroborative evidence is that as far back as 2014, Apple had already allowed headphone manufacturers to connect headphone products through the charging interface. The answer to such news, whether true or false, will only be revealed by Apple at the 2016 Fall launch event. This did not stop industry insiders from taking a positive view of the prospects of iPhone 7 however. Many believed that iPhone 7 could very well be the last time Apple would significantly upgrade the iPhone series. However, data recently published by IDC, a market intelligence firm, showed the market share of iPhone has decreased slightly. Goldman Sachs has rated Apple shares as something that can be "bought". BMO analysts believe that iPhone7 will establish a historical record in sales performance. Broadcom CEO Hock Tan also expressed that Apple is expected to achieve more than 20% growth in revenue. This figure can be completely attributed to the release of iPhone7. 7% of those interviewed said they intend to buy iPhone 7 compared to a mere 4% who planned to buy iPhone 6 two years ago. From information available, 20% of users currently holding an iPhone6 or 6Plus have plans for purchasing iPhone7. This proportion is quite substantial. Next, experts analyzed that most Apple fans like to replace their iPhone every other generation. Statistics revealed that among iPhone users, approximately 26% of users have not changed their mobile phones in two years, i.e., the iPhones of about 120 million users have been used for two years. Some media reported that Taiwan has been hit by several earthquakes during the iPhone7 production period. "Damages sustained by TSMC production facilities may have went beyond expectations, and that could have influenced initial supply for iPhone7." Supply and demand conflicts will influence normal users. It is time to select a proper channel and acquire an authentic iPhone7 early at a low price. Insider disclosure revealed that the upper management of Suning and Apple has met frequently in recent times for the purpose of preparing enough resources. Service operators have reached an agreement with Suning. It can be expected that with growing partnership between the two, users will be provided with lower prices and more dedicated services. " The lowest price. The customers might' only RMB 7 a day to get a iPhone7". Sufficient supply of goods and a variety of discounts, buyers of iPhone 7 will not be so stressed out, and Suning's logistics department will all the more turn this happiness into a more intuitive experience. Perhaps you will receive a phone call at midnight. "Hello, this is Suning.com. Your iPhone 7 has arrived."</div>

	<div class="translation" id="m2d-19">Although it is now autumn, the hot weather after the beginning of autumn seems comparable to the summer. UV rays not only darkens your skin but can also cause sunburn. So how does one get through the rigorous military training without sunburn? Sunscreen generally features a SPF and PA mark. SPF is the measure of how well a sunscreen protects the skin from sunburn, and protect the skin from UVB rays. The common figures we see are SPF of 15, 30 and 50. Products with the PA mark is for UVA rays thus is a more effective sun screen. The strength of the PA is shown with + signs, and any additional + signs represents longer protection time. Those with oily skin should choose water-based sunscreen for deep protection. Sunscreen spray is also a good choice. Those with dry skin should use sunscreen cream and those with neutral skin are not bound with any rules. Any type of skin care products is not good for those with sensitive skin and a 100% pure sunscreen is recommended. It takes time for the sunscreen to seep in thus do not forget to apply the sunscreen 30 minutes beforehand. During the long military training, be sure to apply sunscreen once every two hours to keep it effective. Don't get lazy. The skin is exposed greatly to the sun during military training thus do not use skin whitening products right away. After military training, if possible, wrap ice cubes with a towel and apply it to your burnt skin to cool it down.</div>
	<div class="translation" id="m2d-19">Although autumn has arrived, the bite of the "autumn tiger" has proved to be no less powerful than that of the summer. UV not only darkens the skin, it will also cause sunburns. Is there any solution to help the skin make it through military training and avoid sunburns altogether? The external packaging of sunblock cream is often labeled with SPF and PA. SPF refers to the sun protection factor and specifically targets UVB radiation. Common SPF scores include 15, 30, and 50. Products with the PA label are aimed at UVA. Such sunblocks are more effective. Generally, the strength of PA is indicated by the + sign. Each additional + represents a longer duration of effective protection. For oily skin, choose aqueous sunblock with good penetrability. Sunblock sprays are good options as well. For dry skin, use cream-based anti-sunburn products. Those with neutral skin are not subject to stringent regulations. However, sensitive skin will find application of any product to be a hard burden. Purely physical sunblock products are recommended. Remember to apply the sunblock cream half an hour earlier as the anti-sunburn product needs some time before completely penetrating the skin. Military training includes extended exposure to solar radiation. Anti-sunburn cream must be applied once every 2 hours to sustain the effects. Don't get lazy about this. Since the skin has just been sensitized by exposure to the sun, do not use whitening products immediately after military training. For sunburns endured during military training, ice wrapped in towels can be used to cool scorched skin and alleviate local senses of over-heating.</div>

	<div class="translation" id="m2d-21">On the surface, the social networking platform has expanded the circle of communication and reduced people's loneliness. The social circle of cyberspace has become more and more common. It has not only gradually replaced the traditional means of communication by phone, but is also affecting our social circles. It is quietly changing the social lives of people. The benefits of social networking online are obvious, such as the convenience, and especially cater to the young generation. A survey on college students’ social habits shows that 57% of college students spend more than five hours a day using mobile phones, and it has become inseparable with their daily lives. "The social network has the characteristics of inexpensive, fast, and being able to network with a large crowd, which is in line with the needs of college students today." Expanding the circle of interpersonal relationships, a more equal dialogue, and avoiding social concerns are the main reasons why we love chatting online more. New company staffs likes to communicate with their coworkers online. "As many are not familiar with it, they communicated without borders which built a good relationship among them." People who like to make friends also like to use this. "There was an instance where I had lost contact with someone due to a misunderstanding. However I was able to connect with that person again by conversing in groups." Wu Yan, an IT engineer, is an in-depth social networking enthusiast. Most of his social life happens online, where the number of people online is several times more than those offline. Wu Yan admits that being online is "like being a fish in the water". "You can reply your friends at your own pace. You will be able to express yourself better as you have time to think about what to write." "You can stay behind your online ID and avoid face-to-face conflict; will have the peace of mind to think things out before taking action." "Two different people can come together and communicate at the same level. Thus the social concerns in real life seem to be non-existent online." However, Wu’s friend Xiaopeng thinks that Wu’s life is enclosed and abnormal. Xiaopeng and Wu Yan met in a large group and as they were both active talkers, they quickly became good friends. Xiaopeng felt that Wu Yan and two other people online were bland and did not actively express their opinions. Their replies were often "Oh, ok, really," or "Let me check online."</div>
	<div class="translation" id="m2d-21">On the surface, social networking platforms have widened the social circle and reduced loneliness. The scope of influence of online social networking has become increasingly widespread. Not only has it gradually replaced traditional phone communication, it has even permeated actual offline living circles, quietly changing the social activities of the masses. The benefit of online social networking is obvious. It is easy and convenient, and is therefore much preferred by younger demographics. A survey investigating college student socializing habits found that 57% of college students spend more than 5 hours a day on cellphones, literally making cellphones "inseparable" during everyday lives. "The characteristics of social networks include being low-cost, having fast transmission rates, and allowing many people to interact simultaneously. This suits the needs of contemporary university students. Expanded relationship circles, being able to chat on equal footing, and avoidance of social stigma are the main reasons why we become increasingly fond of online chat. The newcomers enjoy online communication with other employees, " because we are not familiar with each other at the beginning. But the 'like' and comment in the social media will close the distance." People who enjoy making friends also used online networking. "I haven't been contacting a friend for a while due to some misunderstanding. We then shared a few words in a larger group and things got better from there." IT engineer Wu Yan is strong fan for social networking, and spends most of his socializing time and life online, with many more online contacts than friends he meet offline. Wu Yan himself honestly said that he feels like "fish returned to the water" when he goes online. "You may reply to a friend when you are willing at a time that is convenient for you to do so because there is plenty of time for you to deliberate the wordings, and you can also express yourself more clearly." "The ID provides one with a cover to avoid all face-to-face interpersonal conflicts, providing one with more room to maneuver and also provided both sides with more time and space to think about what they say." "People of different status are given the same rights to speech and the same voice. Various social taboos in real life seem to disappear in the online world." Xiaopeng, a friend of Wu Yan, felt that the real life Wu Yan is a "boring geek". Xiaopeng and Wu Yan met in a big group. As they were both active speakers, they became acquainted very quickly. Xiaopeng felt that Wu Yan was completely different from his online personality. The real Wu Yan used little words and never gave any opinions. The only phrases he would use were: "Ho ho. Alright. Really?" or "I'll check that online."</div>

	<div class="translation" id="m2d-22">Unfortunately, the latest OPEC monthly report shows that crude oil production continued to increase in July, and Saudi Arabia's production hit a new high. This report doesn't prevent the market from doubting OPEC. The road to recovery for oil price seems to be a tough one. On Monday, Sada who is OPEC's president and Qatar's Energy Minister said that OPEC will hold an informal meeting during the International Energy Forum on September 26-28. The monthly report released by OPEC on Wednesday showed that all OPEC members including Gabon increased their July production by an additional 46,000 barrels per day to 33.11 million barrels per day. OPEC also said in its monthly report that low crude oil prices have prompted the world's refiners to produce more refined oil products, which has increased the level of excess supply in the market. The international oil price fell for two consecutive days with this news and as the US raised their forecast on crude oil production along with the unexpected increase in crude oil inventory. As of Wednesday's close, the New York Mercantile Exchange's September delivery of light crude oil futures fell 2.48%, and the October delivery of London Brent crude oil futures fell 2.07%. Reuters believes that the proposed meeting of oil-producing countries is unlikely to significantly tighten supply, and data released by the US Energy Information Administration also weighed on market sentiment. Iran’s official news agency Fars quoted Iran’s oil minister Zaganga’s statement on Wednesday, saying that Iran’s maximum daily crude oil output was 3.85 million barrels, which is the highest level since 2008. The result of the meeting was just announced and the Russian Energy Minister Novak stated that there is no need for a new round of negotiations on production freeze with the current oil price. The meeting with the oil-producing country was back in April. OPEC member states were not able to reach an agreement whatsoever.  Emma Richards, an oil and gas analyst at BMI Research, said that the market and the media may be a bit too sensitive to the OPEC meeting. Helima Croft, head of commodities strategy at Royal Bank of Canada, said that OPEC changed market sentiment by releasing signals that they would facilitate the deal. This is like the smoke and mirror method of drawing away attention (and giving the wrong impression). Eugen Weinberg, Head of Commodity Research at Commerzbank AG, said that people think that OPEC is unlikely to try to stabilize the market through the September meeting. This is likely to further undermine the market's confidence in OPEC, after all, the organization has already pulled "the boy who cried wolf."</div>

	<div class="translation" id="m2d-23">At least nine provinces and cities, including Hebei, Jilin, Tianjin, Jiangxi, Sichuan, Hainan, Gansu, Fujian and Beijing, have issued detailed rules for the implementation of residence permits, according to Xinhua. With regard to the conditions for applying for a residence permit, the above-mentioned areas generally propose that they need to live for more than six months and meet one of the conditions for having legal and stable employment, legal and stable residence and continuous schooling. In terms of the treatment offered by residence permits, the "gold content" varies from place to place, and the range of public services and facilities offered in some areas has expanded compared with the state version of the rules. These areas have increased the convenience for children to participate in the local entrance examination under the relevant conditions. In addition, Beijing and other places have also explicitly requested that the scope of the provision of public services and facilities be gradually expanded and made known to the public on a regular basis. For example, Fujian proposed that the scope of public services and facilities enjoyed by holders of residence permits should be made known to the public at least once every three years. According to the Interim Regulations on Residence Permits, the public security organs shall, within 15 days from the date of acceptance, make and issue residence permits for those who meet the requirements for the processing of residence permits. With regard to the time frame for the issuance of certificates, most regions are in agreement with the national version, which is issued within 15 days. Hebei has made it clear that for those who meet the requirements for application and have complete materials, the police station of their place of residence shall issue their residence permits within three working days from the date of acceptance. Jiangxi stipulates that if the conditions for applying for a residence permit are met and the supporting documents are complete, the public security organ shall make and issue a residence permit within five working days from the date of accepting the application. In accordance with the provisions of the Provisional Regulations on Residence Permits, the above-mentioned areas have all made it clear that they will apply for a residence permit for the first time and will be exempted from the payment of documentation fees. For example, Sichuan requires that local police stations or commissioned community service agencies strictly implement the approved charging items and rates, and resolutely prohibit overcharging, overcharging or hitchhiking charges.</div>

	<div class="translation" id="m2d-27">The head of the Industrial Coordination Department of the National Development and Reform Commission said here today that steel overcapacity is a global problem. In recent years, China's capacity utilization rate is higher than the global average and higher than the United States and Europe and other countries and regions. China has taken resolute and effective measures to eliminate excess capacity, and the results are gradually emerging. The person in charge pointed out that the party Central Committee and the State Council attach great importance to the global problem of excess steel production capacity. Various departments and regions have actively implemented the State Council's plan and carried out serious work to reduce crude steel production capacity by about 45 million tons this year. Proceeding from China's national conditions, China does not encourage steel exports, on the contrary, it has also taken a series of practical measures to control steel exports. The official stressed that international trade in steel products is essentially a market behavior, is derived from the importing country demand, consumers comprehensive consideration of product value for money and other factors after the independent choice. The implementation of trade protection measures will not help to fundamentally solve the problem of the development of the global steel industry, on the contrary, it will only cause further impact on the international trade order. When talking about debt, the chief stressed that resolving the debt problem is an important issue that needs to be properly handled in the process of resolving excess capacity. Due to the large scale and wide range of assets of steel enterprises, the debt relationship of some enterprises is complex, and it is possible to trigger regional risks if not handled properly. In recent years, as downward pressure on the economy has increased, aggregate demand in society has gradually weakened, capacity utilization rates in some sectors have declined and enterprises have greater difficulties in production and operation, according to the chief. Some enterprises do not adapt to changes in the market environment, production and operation is difficult to sustain or even close down, but subject to some institutional and institutional factors, there are more obstacles to exit in a market-oriented way and become "zombie enterprises." The existence of such enterprises distorts market signals, reduces the efficiency of factor resource utilization, increases the cost of social management and hinders the establishment of a level playing field. The main reasons for the losses are the same as those faced by the global steel industry - weak market demand and low capacity utilisation. Our country mainly adopts the market mechanism, economic means and the method of rule of law, and the government mainly does a good job in the work of the bottom line and social stability of the staff and workers to ensure a fair and just market order. The person in charge stressed that the next step is to continue to work hard to ensure the completion of the five-year target of 100 million to 150 million tons of crude steel production capacity.</div>
	<div class="translation" id="m2d-27">Today, the head of the Industry Coordination Department of the National Development and Reform Commission pointed out that the excess capacity of steel is a global issue. In recent years, China's capacity utilization rate has been higher than the global average. It is also higher than the United States and Europe and in other countries. China has taken quick and effective measures to resolve the issue of overproduction, and is gradually coming into effect. The person in charge pointed out that the Central Committee and the State Council excess capacity of steel is a global issue. All departments and regions actively implemented the State Council's orders and actively carried them out. The crude steel production capacity this year should be reduced by around 45 million tons. From a national standpoint, China does not encourage the export of steel products. Instead, it adopts a series of practical measures to control the export of steel products. The person in charge emphasized that international trade of steel products is a market-driven decision made by the needs of the importing country based on the price and other factors. The implementation of trade protection measures will not fundamentally solve the problem of global steel industry development. On the contrary, it will only cause further issues to the international market. The person in charge also emphasized that resolving the deficit issue is important and needs to be resolved properly and concurrently with the issue of excess capacity. As the asset and scope of steel making companies are massive, the debt issue of some companies are complex and there will be a regional risk if it is not handled appropriately. According to the person in charge, in recent years, as the pressure of economic downturn has increased, the total social demand has gradually weakened, and the capacity utilization rate of some industries has declined. As a result, the production and operation of enterprises have become increasingly difficult. Some enterprises are unable adapt to the changes in the market, thus production and management are difficult to sustain and lead to bankruptcy. However, due to the constraints of some institutional mechanisms, there are many obstacles to market-based withdrawal which leads to companies becoming "zombie companies". The existence of such enterprises has distorted market signals, reduced resource utilization efficiency, increased social management costs, and hindered the establishment of a fair market environment. The main cause of losses is the same as the predicament faced by the global steel industry. Basically the market demand is weak and capacity utilization is low. Our country mainly adopts market mechanisms, economic instruments, and regulations. The government mainly does a good job for all employees and provide social stability to ensure a fair market. The person in charge emphasized that in the next step, we must diligently continue to do a good job in the production capacity and ensure that the target of reducing 100 to 150 million tons of crude steel production capacity is completed in five years.</div>

	<div class="translation" id="m2d-37">Grecia is an adorable female toucan that exudes a tropical feel. The story of Grecia the toucan has been known early on in the Central American country of Costa Rica. In the press release on August 30th, Grecia who recovered from the surgery showed off her new prosthetic 3D printed beak to the public. The toucan whose beak was hacked off by humans and was dying a year and half ago is now reborn. This day not only confirms that she is 100% healthy, but also is a day when she will be relocated to a luxurious cage and a day for those who care about her to be able to see her. Grecia was a bit shy after moving to her new home but became more lively as she played in the water and ate grapes with her new beak. The engineering specialist did not newly paint the 3D printed beak to serve as a reminder to people of what she went through, thus leaving it in the original white color of the 3D printing material. The outer layer of the beak features a thin wall of keratin, and the inside is generally hollow and is only supported by several thin bone struts. Despite the interior being reinforced, the toucan's beak is still frail and can break when damaged. With the collaboration with the animal rescue center, bird specialists, and a US 3D printing company, the group was able to create several "trial versions" to identify and finally create "the perfect one". Grecia can now skillfully use her new beak to drink water, eat, and even pick up small grains. "The design of the final product took around 2 months and the printing only took 4-5 hours." The president of SG3D Printing, Thomas Lange explained to Xinhua International during an interview that, "3D printing is not a technology of the future but has already stepped in to our lives". In January 2015, a bloodied toucan (Grecia) was found on a farm in Grecia, Alajuela Province located in central Costa Rica. The beak was brutally hacked off by a group of youngsters. She could not eat at all and was in critical condition. After the media covered the story of Grecia's tragic situation, it triggered a wave of opposition on animal cruelty in and outside of Costa Rica. People have since called out for a stricter animal protection law and for harsher penalties for animal abuse. People proactively came together to do their best to help Grecia recover and regain her life before being injured. Chuck Hall who is the inventor of 3D printing was also involved in the design of Grecia's beak. "Grecia's situation was a very special one as there was less than 1 cm of the upper jaw left, which caused many difficulties in attaching the beak." "We first scanned Grecia then designed an extended cap that was a bit longer than the remnant beak, then glued the prosthetic beak". Lange told the reporters of Xinhua International that "By doing so, we can prevent further injury for Grecia". Before installing the prosthetic beak, the staff had to keep Grecia clean everyday to prevent infections. The story of Grecia the toucan travelled the distance and touched John Hoffman who is a producer at Discovery News Channel and Paul Heredia who is a famous documentary director. They filmed bits and pieces of the installation of Grecia's new beak to make a documentary called "Toucan Nation" which was aired on Animal Planet this month. The documentary "Toucan Nation" shows how a small Toucan inspired a nation to make changes and citizens to get involved to stop animal cruelty.</div>
	<div class="translation" id="m2d-37">Gracia is a budding female toucan with the scent of a tropical rainforest. In the Central American country of Costa Rica, the toucan Gracia and its story have long been a household name. At a press conference on August 10, Gracia, who is recovering from surgery, finally appeared to show off her brand-new, 3D printed plastic beak. The dying toucan, which had its beak snapped off a year and a half ago, has been given a new lease of life. This day heralds not only its 100 per cent return to health, but also its move into the luxurious aviary and its meeting with human friends who care about it. Gracia, who had just entered her new home, was a little shy, but soon became active, wallowing in the basin and eating the grapes with her new beak. To remind people of the damage it has suffered, instead of painting its new beak, technicians have kept the original white of the 3D printing material. The beak is covered with a thin, horny sheath that is hollow inside, with only a few thin, bone-supporting poles interlaced. Despite this internal reinforcement, the toucan's beak is still fragile and will break when it is damaged. The Animal Rescue Center, ornithologists and an American 3D printing company worked together to create several "experimental beaks" for Gracia, finally creating the "perfect beak" for her. Gracia is now adept at using her new beak to drink, eat and even pick up tiny grains. "The final product took about two months to design and only four or five hours to print." "3D printing is not the technology of the future, it has really come into your life and mine," Thomas Langer, chairman of SG3D printing company, told Xinhua International. Gracia, a toucan covered in blood, was discovered on a farm in Gracia, in the central Alajuela province of Costa Rica, in January 2015. At that time, its beak was brutally broken by a group of young people, it was completely unable to eat, life-threatening. The tragedy in Gracia has caused a flurry of calls against animal cruelty in and around Costa Rica after media reports. There have been calls for stricter animal protection laws and greater penalties for abusers. People came spontaneously and did their best to help Gracia get back to life as much as possible before the injury. Even Chuck Hull, the inventor of 3D printing technology, was involved in the design of Gracia's upper beak. "The case of Gracia is unique in that the remaining part of its upper beak is less than one centimetre, which makes it difficult to install a new beak," he said. "We scanned Gracia and then designed and made an extended prosthesis that was slightly longer than the rest of her upper beak. "This will reduce further invasive damage to Gracia," Langer told Xinhua International. Before installing the prosthesis, staff had to clean up Gracia's beak every day to prevent infection. Thousands of miles away, the story of Toucan Gracia moved famous documentary filmmaker Paula Heredia and Discovery News producer John Hoffman. They chronicled the installation of Gracia's new beak and recorded a documentary, "Land of the Toucans," which was shown on Animal Planet this month. The documentary "Land of Toucans" shows how a tiny toucan can make a country change for itself, and how it can involve its citizens in the fight against animal cruelty.</div>

	<div class="translation" id="m2d-42">Statistics on high temperature days of various districts provided on portal website of the Chongqing City Meteorological Administration said that with the exception of Youyang County, every area in the city could receive varying amounts of high temperature subsidies. Currently, at least 28 provinces in the country have clarified their subsidy disbursement criteria, but the disbursement criteria differs among provinces. In Chongqing, high-temperature subsidy is received based on subsidy for high-temperature working days. At temperatures equal or more than 35℃ and less than 37℃, each person shall be given a fee of not less than RMB10 per day. At temperatures higher than 37℃, each person shall be given a fee of not less than RMB15 per day. Workers working at above a temperature of 40℃ can receive a monthly subsidy of up to 20 RMB per day (this does not apply to a worker who is already provided with a high temperature operation subsidy according to law). According to this criteria, Kaizhou, which experienced the most number of high-temperature days last month would receive RMB330, while Chengkou which experienced the least number of days would received RMB80. As the highest temperature in Youyang did not exceed the high temperature benchmark, it did not receive any high-temperature subsidy. In the past, many companies often use cooling and refreshing beverages to offset the high temperature subsidy. The city administration of work safety, however, expressed that this act is not compliant to the current laws. Employers may not deduct or reduce the salary of laborers if work has to be suspended or work time reduced due to high temperatures. The municipal human resources and social security bureau said that workers who worked under high temperatures without receiving high temperature allowance may fight for their legal rights by way of the labor dispute mediation mechanism, or call 12333 to file a complaint. In case employer refuse to pay high-temperature allowance, employee is entitled to complain to the local administrative authority of HR and social security at the county level. Also, since the high temperature subsidy is considered part of the salary and not a benefit, it is included in total salary and subject to the personal income tax. High temperature subsidies are not included considered part of the minimum wage and must be issued in the form of cash. They cannot be replaced in the form of beverages or other tangible items.</div>
	<div class="translation" id="m2d-42">According to statistics of the Chongqing Municipal Meteorological Bureau portal on the high-temperature weather in various districts and counties except Fuyang, the rest of the city may have a deviance on the high temperature. Currently, there are at least 28 provinces in China that have clearly defined the standards for the subsidy. However, the standards issued by provinces and cities are not the same. Chongqing, on one other hand, receives heat allowances in the form of heat allowances on weekdays. If the temperature is 35°C to 37°C , a rate of not less than 10 yuan per person per day; if it exceeds 37°C, the rate shall not be less than 15 yuan per person per day. Workers working in high temperature environment above 40°C can receive up to 20 yuan per day per month (except for laborers who already receive the heat allowance according to law). According to this standard, Kaizhou, had the most days of high-temperature weather last month, and was able to receive 330 yuan, and Chengkou had the least number of days which equated to 80 yuan. The highest temperature recorded in Puyang did not reach the high temperature standard, so there was no heat allowance. In the past, many would give cold drinks instead of heat allowances. The City Work Safety Administration stated that such practices are not in line with current regulations. The employer may not deduct or reduce the wages of workers due to the stoppage of work due to high temperature and reduce working hours. The Municipal Bureau of Human Resources and Social Affairs stated that when an employee faces a situation where a the work environment is considered high-temperature but does not receive a heat allowance, he or she can seek legal rights through the labor dispute mediation agency where the company is located, or call 12333 to file a complaint. Where a company refuses to issue a heat allowance, the laborer may complain to the appropriate department in human resources and social security at or above the county level where the employment is located. Also, because heat allowances are part of wages and not benefits, they must be included in total wages and deducted from taxes. Therefore, the heat allowance is not part of the minimum wage and must be paid in cash. It cannot be replaced with physical items such as drinks.</div>

But they grow extremely slowly, sometimes only about 1cm a year, suggesting that Greenland sharks may have an extraordinarily long life. Traditional dating methods typically use calcified tissue from animals, and some sharks may use fins, but this calcified tissue is rare in Greenland sharks. The new study, led by Julius Nielsen of the University of Copenhagen in Denmark, turned to radiocarbon dating using the eye lens of the Greenland shark. The method has previously been used to determine the age of whales, but it is the first time it has been used to determine the age of fish such as sharks. Their analysis showed that the largest shark had an estimated lifespan of 392 years, with a margin of error of 120 years. This means that the shark is at least 272 years old and is likely to reach a maximum of 512 years old. In addition, female Greenland sharks reportedly do not reach sexual maturity until they are about 4 metres in length, which translates into an age of at least 156 years. As a result, the researchers wrote in their paper, the Greenland shark is the longest-living vertebrate known on Earth, surpassing the previous long-lived champion right whale (211 years old).</div>

According to the Forestry Department of Jilin, the 1998 data from a joint monitoring exercise by China, the US and Russia showed that there were only four to six Siberian tigers, and three to five Amur leopards living in the wild in Jilin Province. According to Yu Changchun, director of the conservation section of the Jilin Forestry Department, said that Jilin Province has been expanding protection efforts for the wildlife. The populations of the northeastern tiger and northeastern leopard have achieved significant growth and their ranges have been growing as well. Data from the latest monitoring in 2015 revealed that 27 Siberian tigers and 42 Amur leopards living in the wild were detected within Jilin Province. As flagship species of World Animal Protection distributed across the China-Russia border, the China-Russia partnership is especially meaningful to restore and increase the populations of northeastern tigers and leopards. According to the Department of Forestry of Jilin, the province has established a long-term and stable system of cooperation and exchange. During the 2016 International Conference for the Conservation of Hunchun Tigers and Leopards of China that concluded on the 11th, forestry agencies and animal protection groups of China and Russia have once again reached multiple consensus.

For example, the land development percentage in Jiangsu Province in 2015 was as high as 21%, which puts it the highest in the provinces and autonomous regions. Therefore, the problem of high pollution, large energy usage, and land occupation has not yet been fundamentally dealt with from the change in production and lifestyle. On one hand, Jiangsu Province ranks first in the country on the effectiveness of the use of land; however, on the other hand, it places a large burden on the resource and environment.

For example, in 2015, the extent of land development in Jiangsu Province was 21%, the highest among all provinces and autonomous regions in the country. Therefore, there has been a lack of radical response to issues pertaining to heavy pollution, big energy and large land coverage in terms of a change in production methods and lifestyle. On the one hand, based on the results of the establishment of various levels and types of ecological environment in Jiangsu Province, it ranks first on an overwhelming basis.
